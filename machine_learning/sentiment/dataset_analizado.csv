Taco Bell is my guilty pleasure fast food joint, and this one happened to be right on my way home. Pulled on in, placed my order with a friendly team member, and then picked it up promptly thereafter. Parked in their lot and stuffed my face rapid-fire.

Successful trip all-around. I also like this spot because it's one of the newer locations. It just looked very clean from what I saw. (I believe this existed with the old facade when I was a kid, also, but I was a kid so I don't fully remember.)

The staff here is always helpful, busy, yet attentive to the needs of a buffet style restaurant.

I've gone to the location a couple times and EVERY TIME their service and food sucks. Not only did they mess up all three of my orders the ""manager"" Patricia, fail to at least listen to my complaint. I got my orders to go so there wasn't very much I could do after I got home. Keep in mind I wasn't asking for a refund or new plates, I simply want to make them aware of their mistakes. 

Here's what I ordered:
1st plate- broccoli and beef, sesame chicken and fried rice
2nd plate- half fried rice, half white rice and mixed veggies only teriyaki sauce on the side
3rd plate- kids meal chicken teriyaki, half fried rice and half mixed veggie with a lemonade 

What I got:
1st plate: orange chicken, sesame chicken and fried rice
2nd plate- half friend rice half chow mein and mixed veggies 
3rd plate- chicken teriyaki, half chow mein and half fried rice; no sauce at all for teriyaki, lemonade was more like water with a hint of lemon

When I spoke with the manager she argued that the teriyaki sauce for the TERIYAKI CHICKEN was only given on request, I should tasted the lemonade before driving off, and that she was not going to compensate for their mistakes. I didn't want to be compensated. The food sucked anyway.I just wanted to let them know the change their lemonade!

The wait wasn't too long but the cashier over billed us for Shrimp, and I'll have to  assume it was an accident on her part.   We didn't order shrimp! I paid by CC and handed my card back to her, asking for the proper credit; the look on her face was full of fright as she obviously didn't know how to do it.  Instead she asked if I wanted an egg roll, I said no, please just refund the overage.  She called over three other staff, and none of them could figure out how to give me a refund via credit card.  So a fourth employee came over and just told her to give me cash.  That probably would have been good enough but she didn't include the tax, so when I mentioned that to her, she rolled her eyes and two other staff smirked at me.  I then asked for a manager, and the guy told me he was in charge but he was not the manager.  He apologized and said he would talk to everyone.

I haven't lived in Tucson for two years and rarely get to have Eegee's so this is a bummer of an experience. 

The reason why it is getting two stars though is that we waited 21 minutes for a sandwich and two orders of fries. I sat here as I watch people who ordered after me, get there food. The associate at the counter didn't keep track of his orders so he didn't realize we were still waiting. We were sitting in the table right in front of his register. It wasn't until I spoke up (15 minutes in) that they even realized we were missed. 

Another 5 minutes went by and then we got our food. When I opened my sandwich it was not what I ordered. So, I had to wait another few minutes for a new sandwich to be made.

Note, watch for the coupons in the Sunday later to receive this dinner for just $20.

But, my order was taken by somebody else and it took me about 5 minutes to get somebody's attention to try and get my issue addressed.

By the time they had started remaking my meal, another customer came in with my meal that they had accidentally taken. There were no apologies and I felt like they had no care. 

My main reason for not one starring that place is that they are very busy and the drive-thru line was out into the other parking lots and the line inside was real long.  the poor guy at the register was barely keeping up with anything and it took a while before they got somebody else on a register.

The other reason I didn't one star this time was because part of it is my fault for trying to do an order here after so many issues. In addition, the food still is presented as it is at other places and I had no problems with its quality.

The short young man (also with glasses) working the drive thru as a cashier then proceeded to deliberately not come back to the window for a full 15 min.  What they both did was serve the 5 cars behind us food and drinks by walking outside.  My wife eventually called the manager by dialing the Sonics number on their website.  A female manager answered with the worst static connection ever.  My wife tried to explain what was going on and finally told her to just come to the drive thru window where we had been sitting for 15 min.  The manager did not come to the drive thru and instead sent a different polite young man who remade the drink in about 10 sec and apologized.  The very immature staff had clearly done this before and were not concerned with consequences due to a complete lack of management at this location - AVOID!,0,1,0,0

Our order was pretty simple...two cups of chili, two baked potatoes with cheese and bacon, two large chocolate Frosties, and two large sodas. My husband grabbed one of the plastic cups used for ketchup in the dining area and asked for a small amount of vanilla ice cream for our Chihuahua who was with us in the car. The cashier has misplaced the cup and seemed lost about how to go about getting another one. Do they not stock these behind the counter? Anyway it was located and Rocky thoroughly enjoyed his mini Frosty! Then the cashier bagged our order with the order of the lady who was behind us. The cashier asked for receipts so she could verify which food belonged to which person resulting in the other customer having to return to her table to retrieve her receipt. There were no napkins in the dispenser in the dining room, and instead of refilling it the staff just kept handing people big stacks of napkins from behind the counter. Ok, customers have napkins, but probably way more than they needed and probably being wasted. Another customer inquired about breakfast items (they were not on the posted menu, but it was advertised that they offer breakfast). The cashier said, ""I don't know. I don't know what to tell you."" It also took way longer than it should have to receive our pretty simple order. I'm giving three stars because the food was good, and normally there are no issues with service in the drive thru.

I love Eegee drinks but they are pretty sweet. I always get a smaller size because less is more in this case. If you prefer lightly sweet though they do offer one flavor (skinny berry) which has less sugar and calories. The have a different featured flavor of Eegee every month and Rodeo Root Beer during rodeo week (it's a must try). Their sandwiches and pretzels are just ok. The few times I've had them I wasn't too impressed (maybe because I'm not a native Tucsonan?). Honestly, I'm guilty of just getting an Eegee and a cookie then going to Jimmy Johns for my sandwich.

In regards to a separate occasion: my dad who is about 78 years old stopped by and ordered inside. He speaks Español but that should not have been an issue because yes 9 times out of 10 there is more than 1 assistant who speaks Español at this location. He came home with HALF FILLED panda bowls (only 1 side not 2). I asked him why he ordered this. He said he wanted a side of fried rice, a side of chow mein, and a side of orange chicken separate from 2 additional complete bowls. The problem was the fact that he ordered the sides in a bowl and the assistant did not bother to explain en Español that there is a cheaper option to order these sides. Yes, they charged him the full amount of a regular panda bowl. I did not go back because he had thrown out his receipt. 

I don't trust drive thru ordering either. Half the time you will receive an incorrect side or entree. If I am not personally watching them scoop my food into the trays or bowls, I would not order from here. My dad will definitely not be returning.",1,0,0,0

21755,2,5,2019-03-10,"Being a single mom, sometimes I want a break from  the grind of cooking every night after putting in a long day at work. Fast food isn't great overall in my opinion, but El Pollo Loco makes delicious, healthy meals you can pick up in a snap! Their citrus marinated, grilled chicken is so amazing! The skin is crispy and caramelized and the meat is tender and tasty. Their family meals include 12 pieces of chicken, three large side dishes (mac and cheese, pinto beans, broccoli, etc), tortillas, and salsas of your choosing. We like to make little burritos out of our chicken and beans.

If you prefer burritos, try the chicken avocado.  Chicken, avocado, pinto beans, and a very tasty cabbage slaw. It's my favorite thing on the menu! Their guacamole is made fresh daily from real avocados. It's so yummy and pairs greatly with their freshly cooked, crispy, warm tortilla chips.

When I'm feeling weak and hungover I sometimes pop in here on my way to work for a #1 with a small oj..more times than I can remember the order gets messed up. The drive through takes forever and by the time you get your bag you're frustrated and late and you drive off without noticing you got a bacon biscuit sandwich instead of your egg McMuffin....devastating lol

Now recently an employee was moving to california to work remotely and as his going away party we catered in McDonald's (kind of a gag party but you should give it a go). I went inside because I knew this wasn't a drive through order..I ordered probably 15 mc doubles half without onions.. 10 4 pc McNuggets.. flurries..several Big Macs..fries..pies..etc..we went all out. The woman at the counter was so nice and I got all that food faster than any drive though experience. What's even better is instead of ringing up everything separately she rang them in as pick twos for $4 or something...I spent way less than expected!

21796,5,1,2017-02-07,"Updating to 1 star (wish I could update to 0 stars) after my last experience at this location. 

In my previous review I covered the outrageous prices this location charges for their items.  Well, they've only gotten worse in other areas since my last visit.  Let's start at the top.  Slow service in the lobby.  And when I say slow, I mean every person should expect to wait at least 20 minutes minimum for their order.  This leads to a lot of people standing around the lobby waiting for their food.  The drive through seems to get ALL priority at this location.  I happened to be talking to an ex-employee while waiting for my food and they said it's because the drive through orders are only given 30 seconds by management to be completed.  This is a management failing and it leads to the inside being completely ignored so that the people working there can meet the 30 second drive through time limit.  If you don't want to wait around for long period's of time while your food is given the lowest priority on prep, then go through the drive through. 

Now, my last visit.  came in and mentioned an issue I had on a previous visit.  Manager on duty didn't seem to care.  Was dismissive, and ignored me.  Fine, whatever.  It's ridiculous but I didn't care that much since it was a small order anyway, I just thought i'd bring it to their attention. The attitude was very off-putting, though. Hopefully you don't have any issues with food, because it's likely to get ignored.

The restaurant was a mess.  Dirty and it looked like they were ignoring the mess on purpose.  Someone made a mess of one of the booths and nobody even attempted to clean it up.  It was still there when I left.    

I have started going to the location in Berlin, because it seems better run than this location.  Keep in mind the Berlin location is twice as far from my house as this location.  I will go double the distance to avoid having to come to this taco bell when I want taco bell.  That's how bad it is.

21808,22,5,2016-08-12,"NEEDED to write another review of Bon Bon, because I have stopped in here several times since September of 2014 and Bon Bon has more than once answered the siren sushi call for a girl on a ramen and potatos budget.

First of all, all of my previous complaints are clearly a thing of the past. Their rolls are delicious, well made, and fresh tasting--not to mention at a great price. You come to Bon Bon when you need sushi in your life immediately. The 3/12$ sushi roll deal is still very reasonable and is a perfect size for a meal, but it's worth the splurge to spring for a delicious Dragon Roll or a sushi burrito. The Bonzilla is their most popular sushi burrito and it really is delicious--created a new craving that I never knew existed. I'm not mad!

Do not come to Bon Bon expecting ceramic tea kettles and tinkling classical music in the background while you whisper so as to not break the eerie (or artistic) silence of a classy japanese restaurant. Let's be real--sometimes we're just not into that mood lighting while we brutally murder how sushi should be eaten with our poor chopstick skills.

Sometimes you just need a quick place to grab a delicious bag of sushi to go. Call ahead and you'll get it fast so you can be in home in time to watch your favorite reality tv show. What... I cant be the only one!

My go-to is the Bonzilla (sushi burrito). I was very skeptical the first time I tried it because let's face it, a ""sushi burrito"" sounds a little strange. I took the first bite and I was hooked - and one sushi burrito is pretty filling. For $8.50, that's a great deal! Delivery is always really quick, too. My order has always been correct.

My only suggestion for improvement would be to expand the menu a little. With another sushi competitor such as Kooma in West Chester, the options at Bon Bon are lacking. The biggest thing that keeps me coming back is the price.",1,0,0,0

One thing I can say is the results are consistent..... consistently subpar.  I love pizza hut but the pizza just doesnt ever taste like the pizza hut I'm used to from other locations.  It has a taste that is just off, every time. And the slices are precut and split out so far causing the pizza to cool down very fast versus just leaving it together.  

My last order I got a pan pizza with extra cheese and due to it being thicker than the hand tossed it was still warm by the time drove down the street 5 mins to my home.

I wish they could improve the taste and quality of their pizza. For now I think I'm giving up on pizza hut and going to Marco's Pizza which is closer and who's pizza are hot and just taste better than anything I've received from this location.

Although I don't eat here much anymore like I did when I was younger... I just don't like the burgers HOWEVER... I saw the menu had a photo of the burger with the advertised of ""freshly made."" I had hoped for a Quarter Pounder that looked like the picture (as if)!
   As I talked to the person at the speaker I noticed that they no longer had the screen for you to see your order. Just a boring speaker with tiny holes. I ordered a Quarter Pounder with cheese, plain. And chicken strips. The guy said no chicken or salad after midnight. Okay then I will have an apple pie. ""NO Apple pies after midnight either."" Okay, I will have the combo then with my burger (adding fries and a Dr. Pepper) I pulled around and waited for a few minutes for the car in front of me to get his order. Oh, I almost forgot... they also said cash only! Luckily I had a $20. 
   Anyway, The guy at the window was very friendly. He appeared to be the only person in the whole place. He kept walking away to somewhere. I gave him my money and he left and came back with my change. He then walked away again for awhile. Came back with my drink. Walking away again he came with my food. And man was it hot! I ate almost all of the fries before I got home and the burger was delicious ! I never thought I would say that about a McDonald's hamburger! Juicy and hot!

Party: 1 (Myself)

Awesome place! Have never been inside, but have ordered from here tons of times, and they are always delicious, speedy, and have great customer service.

CUSTOMER SERVICE = 5 Stars
The delivery guy or gal has always been super nice and wants to start a mini conversation while you're signing a receipt or paying with cash. You can tell they don't want an awkward delivery of ""Here you go. Bye!"" They try to make the encounter as friendly and inviting as possible. Additionally, on the rare occasion if something was left out, I just called them up and they were back at my door within minutes. That's dedication!

FOOD = 5 Stars
I'm always impressed with their selection. My usual, whenever I order, is the #16 CLUB LULU.  It's basically a turkey and bacon club sandwich. Super delicious and I never regret ordering it, and sometime I spice it up by adding some roast beef. Love they have different options, and how you can add things (like extra meats or sauces) and say how much you want on the sandwich (Extra, Reg, EZ, or None). And some of those extras come free!

ATMOSPHERE = N/A
Like I said, I've never been inside, but based on how it looks whenever I've passed by, I would say it looks like a cute little deli environment, with small-medium seating. So if you have a group of like 10+, maybe make the choice of pick up or delivery!

FINAL THOUGHTS
Great place to go to for a light lunch or dinner, especially if you are looking to eat lunch in the Office (that's what I do). We all know that lunch break can go by fast.

Other competing outlets heat it well and make the wrapper nice and crispy.  This was a mess! The wizard server forgot to place my meat choice into the wrap.

Next we tried the bon bon tacos and bonzilla sushi burrito. The tacos were decent but we felt they needed something to give it a kick of spice. The bonzilla burrito was pretty awesome. Its has spicy tuna, shrimp tempura, avocado, and cucumber with a few sauces to give it great flavors. This was definitely the best thing we tried.

Lastly we got a few sushi rolls. Philadelphia, spicy tuna, and chicken tempura. The rolls were fresh but nothing out of the ordinary.

21892,27,5,2018-01-04,"So glad to see a healthy offering close to home! The menu is simple: pick your protein- beef, chicken, tofu, or beef/chicken combo; pick your base- white rice, brown rice, or salad; pick a size. The veggies are fresh, steamed for 1 minute so they are still crisp and flavorful and the meat is marinated in a special teriyaki sauce and grilled. No added fats or oils, just good honest food. 
I'm confused as to why some reviewers thought the food was ""flavorless"", the portions small, or the staff disinterested. We did not find this to be true at all. As prepared, the meal is not drowning in sauce as with some Asian dishes (Panda Express, anyone?). For those who want to sauce it up, or add extra heat there is a sauce bar (free) where you can create a swimming pool for your meal if you choose. Not my style, but some may like this. The regular portion was equal to that at any rice bowl restaurant and filled me up to the ""very full"" level.  If you are a light or heavy eater you can choose whatever size suits you. The value was excellent.  At $7.99 including drink it is hard to find a meal any other place except McDonalds.  I'll take the healthy, fresh, and flavorful option please!

The side items are pretty much limited to edamame, seaweed salad, miso soup and fried shrimp shumai, plus drinks.

I've taken away a star for service. I've been here quite a few times, since it's just done the street from my house and my order correctness has only been 1 time. My order is always wrong, but since it's so close to my house, I don't want to go back to get it fixed. Another star is taken away from value. I like their salads, but they are pre-made. Here's my problem with that, I don't like everything in them, so I ask for them to be removed. The logical thing to me, is replace it with something else, but they don't. So here I am paying about $5 for not even half of the small salad. It's not worth it to take anything off.

First off, my daughter passed on ordering because they do not offer a gluten free bun and the guy at the counter said that all buns were gluten free. I knew this was incorrect. He read the ingredients and sure enough, white flour. He was looking for gluten in the ingredients. Maybe more training on that for employees would help. Then, a hot dog, 2 fries, and 2 burgers (one small child size and a bacon burger) with 2 drinks was close to $35.00! Gulp!!! We go to Culvers and they have Udis gluten free buns for my daughter and get sundaes for everyone & it ends up being cheaper and much better quality and quantity! Never again.

Teriyaki sauce speckles the rice to create a deep sweetness saltiness, and savouriness. Inside the wrap, there is smooth and creamy avocado, deeply flavorful tuna, and shrimp tempura.

The balance of the mouthfeel won me. The soft rice, creamy avocado and tuna, crisp cucumber slivers and shrimp bring many unique textures to the palate. 

The flavor profile is savoury, but also lightly sweet. The tuna give a sharp acidic spiciness that is balanced nicely by the fat of the avocado and light hint of oil in the shrimp tempura.

There was just me and a car in front of me at the drive-thru window.  Even if this isn't considered fast-food, the wait was excessive.  I didn't really see that the car in front of me ordered a ton of food, but I waited way too long to get to the window and then place my order and wait some more.  I wondered if I was supposed to order at the menu, so I even backed up to check, and wasn't greeted, so I guess you order at the window.  I asked the girl if there was a speaker or way to order back there, and she said no.  So, I guess you order and get your food at the window and it just takes a long time.

I ordered a regular gyro ($4.99), and the free medium soda that was in the Yelp app for checking in.  I asked what was in the gyro (Gyro meat, Tzatziki sauce, tomato & onion) and asked about the onions - if they were finely diced, or ... ?  - and she said they have an onion chopper, so, yes, finely chopped.  No.  No, they were not.  I had giant pieces of raw onion in my gyro.  So, I opened it and picked them out (I like onions, but not big when raw).  But worse than that - the meat was so salty.  I mean nearly inedible salty.  And peppery - a little too much for my taste, but that could just be me.  But the salt.  Gah, that salt.  Too much.

After waiting for my order everything that I asked to be removed from my sandwiches i.e. cheese, mayo & ketchup, my order had all of those things on the sandwiches. I wasn't going to to spend another 10 minutes waiting for them to fix my order correctly. The MOD was taking orders he had on no mask or gloves & was vey attentive to his cell phone between orders. One of the sandwich makers had on a mask but no gloves & one had on gloves but no mask although it is posted that PPE is to be worn by all employees.

Burgers are ok, not spectacular. My favorite is the fish sandwich, although I wish they would turn the clock back 30 years. Back in 1989 when I moved to Tampa area, Checkers had the world's best fish sandwich. A nice filet that hung over both sides of the bun. Sadly now it's the standard pressed square patty.

22071,25,1,2017-09-13,"I think everyone has seen the movie Harold & Kumar Go To White Castle. I used to eat White Castle after elementary school as a snack when my mother was lazy and just microwaved a few of them for me and my siblings to hold us over until dinner. I was in St. Louis and it was after midnight and literally NOTHING else was open. This meant that we were making a White Castle run and hoping for the best. It was a BAD decision. The actual place was closed so we had to go through the drive-through line. This is where all our problems started. I don't know WHAT was going on but it took over 15 minutes for us to even PLACE the order and this wasn't because there was a long line. It was ridiculous. 

We tried the Double Cheese Sliders (2 beef patties on a bed of onions, American Cheese, pickles), Chicken Breast Sliders (lightly breaded, crispy chicken breast made with all white meat, American cheese), Chicken Rings (all white-meat chicken breaded) and fries. Everything tasted like cafeteria food. I think only the chicken rings were somewhat passable and that's only after I drowned it in ketchup. As far as the sliders go, stick to beef and avoid the chicken. The Chicken sliders are so dry that they are basically inedible. The beef sliders are flavorless but a lot of ketchup can save almost anything. The fries were even terrible too. Limp and not even served hot. 

I don't understand why anyone would ever voluntarily eat at White Castle. I will honestly say that it is the WORST fast food joint I've ever been to with the WORST service I've ever received. I don't even think it's all that cheap neither. Never again even if they're the only place open! I'll save my calories! 1/5",0,1,0,0

The store is totally disorganized or they don't have enough employees to keep up with the volume, or both, as well as other issues that were not obvious. There was a female employee who was putting guacamole and other sauces in to go cups, and if she moved any slower, she'd be going backwards. Another employee was not changing gloves between tasks so a customer called her out on it. The employee then went to the sink, washed her hands, and put on new gloves. I saw no manager helping out. I ordered a single cheese quesadilla online on Thursday night at 6:08 and the app said it would be ready by 6:20. I went and waited. At 6:25 I inquired and an employee said they were making mine next. A few other people were waiting for orders too. There were not that many customers in the store waiting to order in person. I waited and waited and waited. After asking a few more times, she kept telling me it was coming. What a joke. Finally at 6:37, I walked out with my single cheese quesadilla. It took 29 minutes! That's a ridiculous amount of time to take to make that order. If you're ordering online, assume it will take at least a half hour no matter what the app tells you.

Dual ownership teams have brought sit-down family dining/fast food to Sahuarita; FINALLY!

I met John Elam today (one of the owners) and learned how he not only secured this spot in the area but his expectations for his employees; I was impressed. In fact, Chik-Fil-A has competition in this area and that's a good thing!

We visited the restaurant on Thursday, 11 July, for an early dinner way past the opening day mark just to see how things are after the dust settled... We were impressed. 

Food quality was fresh, hot, served with a genuine smile. The restaurant grounds, dining area and overall build was in an appealing and welcoming condition and the fresh color scheme of Culver's is a nice add to the constant 'south western' themes of the southwest. The blues and grays along with the inside seating design is very comfortable both visually and physically. On this Thursday, the place was approximately 80% packed. That's great!

We learned that the ownership team wants all customers to truly be treated as guests of honor and have raised their bar - on that experience; KUDOS!! It's no mystery that the McDonalds and Carl's Jr. in this area has to be labeled the world's worst so if Culver's can hit them where it counts, maybe it'll be good for all three as the new team in town makes a better impression on the community as a whole. Currently, the other two suffer immensely in EVERY detail of sales, quality and customer interface so again, KUDOS to the management team behind Culver's, you should see exactly what I'm referring to when you walk in.

To note: security cameras - literally everywhere. I like that. You should too. Free Wi-Fi and outdoor seating with USB charge ports in a couple areas of the inside dining area and T.V.'s up on the wall. It's the perfect blend of sit down-fast food-restaurant style eating.

Upon an inspection of the order, it stuck out that they made a few mistakes in the order which could have been easily avoided by taking a few seconds to read the order slip in its entirety. This may have been the 3rd or 4th time I have had issues with my orders at this location, all due to blatant disregard of the staff, and while I have not pointed it out before, I decided that this time I would call to ask specifically with the manager. When I called, some female whose name started with an M., but was the only female working that shift, picked up the phone. I briefly told her about the issues, and she offered to assist should I drive back, but I politely asked to bypass her and speak with a manager instead. She obliged and put me on hold, but instead of putting me on mute, I was able to overhear her drop f-bombs (specifially saying ""I told him..., but he wanted to speak with you. What the f***"" )about me to her shift leader, Jeffrey, as she called him to pick up the phone. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!?!?!? I've been in the food service industry before and you should never have the audacity to curse about a customer like that and, even if you cannot hold it in, you don't do it with the phone on!!! This is common sense.

Honestly, I love Qdoba's food and this one is the closest location otherwise I would go to another location in a heartbeat. I have dealt with multiple wrong orders, overcharges, and having the staff ignore me as I am waiting to order as the only person in line but when I heard this, I lost all my appetite and decided to drive all the way back just to confront this individual and have a productive conversation. By the time I got there, the girl was hiding in the back, but I did have a conversation with the shift leader Jeffrey and, in all fairness, he did apologize (hopefully it was sincere, but I will never know for sure) about the situation and offered to give me 3 free entree cards. Jeffrey told be about how there is a lot of staff turnaround which results in a lack of training. While I do not think this excuse justifies this individuals' actions in any way, I can only hope that she gets the message that the phones are extremely sensitive and the customer can hear anything you say especially since due to the pandemic most orders are online/phone orders. She needs training, but I really do not think that an employee like her represents Qdoba in a good light.

Overall, I am honestly surprised how this location is still open aside from it being the closest one to the West Chester area. I have had issues with the staff and food of specific location for years and, after this interaction, I can guarantee that I would rather drive 15 extra miles than come back to this place since it does not seem that they ever change. Judging by the other reviews on google and yelp, I do not think that I am the only one who has had issues with the staff, and they need some customer centric training as soon as possible. I would give this location 1 star, but the added star is only for Jeffrey because he tried to remedy the situation.",1,0,0,0

The Vito original Italian sub sandwich is my go to. It is about 8"" inches, depending on the day, and includes genoa salami, provolone cheese, capicola, onion, lettuce, tomato & a real tasty Italian vinaigrette. I like to add the Jimmy John's spicy mustard and the hot peppers to give it an extra kick. 

If you decide to order from the online you have the ability to modify the sandwiches a lot more. There are options for each ingredient to choose XTRA, REG, EZ, or NO. Some of the modifications will add some extra charges and other options are no cost. I prefer this method when ordering.

One downside I do have have with all Jimmy John's is the consistency of the sandwich. Sometimes they are really good and other times it seems as if they didn't take the time to add certain ingredients or very little.",1,0,0,0

So, nevermind who is at fault, did I pick up the wrong sandwich, if so, why didn't they stop me, they claim to have tried, but I heard nothing, and the general manager actually admitted that she didn't want to follow me out the door, probably too lazy I'm guessing.  There was plenty of time to get my attention.  After picking up the ""wrong"" sandwich which they had just called me to do, I turned around and filled up my cup with a drink, so I was literally standing right there for another 30 seconds.  When I got back to work, realized I had someone else's order,  I called them and the same boy that checked me out, answered the phone, after a heated exchange due to his behaviour he finally said to me: "" you were in too big of a hurry for me to let you know that you picked up the wrong sandwich and it's your fault"", and then hung up on me...twice because I called back to iron it out with this little kid.  I called a 3rd time only to get hung up by the general manager.  Pretty epic, no sorries, no refunds, no nothing except accusations that I was in a hurry,  that I took the wrong sandwich, it's my fault,  and a then, a dial tone again.  Now, in my older days, this would not have gone so good for the rude little boy behind the counter, but I have come to realize that nature with cure him on my behalf.  After all, some people need life's lessons more than others, he will get his.

So, if you get the wrong order, or let's say, they claim you picked up the wrong order, and then tell you it's your fault, the general manager made it clear that the owner doesn't care either, and refused to give me the owner's contact information.

Culver's in Sioux Falls, SD was a special place my Dad used to take me too for their famous butter burgers and custard shakes, since I was a little girl. I was born and raised in CA (and we don't have Culver's.....but if anyone is listening...PLEASE bring them to NorCal)

My father recently passed away and I was racing through the desert to deal with the estate, after a long flight and my ETA was 10:01 to Culver's. They closed at 10pm. Culver's reminds me of so many wonderful memories with my Dad and my heart was set on it.

I called the restaurant and begged them to stay open for me if I was a few minutes late and I was greeted with the kindest, warmest, sweetest voice on the other line who said they would do it just for me!!I was so thankful.

I pulled up, the screen was dark. An automation informed me they were closed. My heart sank and then that same, warm voice came over the speaker, ""Hi Crystal!!! Welcome to Green Valley!! Go ahead and pull up to the window!!""

The pumpkin shake was delicious, the burger divine, but the kindness and human connection was by far the best part of my meal.

This team brought tears to my eyes. They were so loving, so encouraging, the most wonderful example of hospitality. 

Thank you Green Valley, AZ Culver's team working 9/30/2021 at 10pm. 

*ETA* I am amending my review to 100 stars 
And to also include the names of the team members that made my year.

I ordered a supreme pizza and when the employee gave me the pizza, he stopped and looked at the computer...paused with an opps looks, then handed the pizza to me.  I thought it was weird that there was a pause with a look of confusion and then he didn't open the box like normal.  I should have looked myself but was in a hurry.  When I got home opened the box to find a Cheese Pizza not a Supreme.  When I called them back they said I could come back and they would make another. I didn't have time to do this so I said I would take a refund and pick it up later after my class.  When I made it back to Pizza Hut about 2 hours later, the same guy that handed me the pizza,  was there to help me again.  1st he said I didn't order it from them as he said he didn't see me in their system.  I quickly responded you are the one that handed it to me.  I then took out my phone and showed him the email receipt.  I said I was there for my refund and his words were...""I don't know anything about it"".  Not knowing this guy with poor customer service skills was the manager, I asked to speak to the manager on duty and he said that it was him.  I told him I called immediately when i got home and was told i would get a refund for the mistake...a Cheese Pizza was not a Supreme Pizza.  He grunted and called another guy to the front to show him how to do refunds.  He put the money on the counter even though my hand was there to receive the money and shoved a receipt at me to fill out.  Told the other person you have to MAKE them fill this out...no words spoken to me the customer standing in front of him.  He was apparently pissed that I wanted a refund because they made a big mistake.

I was handed my remaining 2 orders about 8-10 minutes later only to find out that they forgot the drink that was ordered online.

22253,40,2,2021-06-29,"Here we go again with lack of senior discount!

Placed my order to go and specifically mentioned my senior discount to counter person....twice. 

When food was brought to me (inside) there was no senior discount on my receipt. It's almost like the employees are programmed to NOT hear the words 'senior discount'. This is the 4th or 5th time this has happened. 

Went back to the employee who took my order and asked,  ""Do you remember me asking for my senior discount""?  She said, ""No"", even though it had only been about 10 minutes since she took my order. Guess she doesn't have a very good memory???

My bill was $18.58 before tax was added. 

She then returned $0.27 to me for my discount. 
I put the $0.27 back down on the counter and said that is not even close to my senior discount. 

Then this 'manager', who looked like she was barely out of high school,  came over to see what the problem was. 

I explained what the problem was and she VERY reluctantly recalculated my discount. She returned $0.78 to me, with an attitude, that she was doing me a big favor. 

I also knew that was not the correct amount for my senior discount, but my blood pressure was going up, so I took it and went out the door. 

BTW: They give a 5% discount for seniors. So on a $18.58 bill, before adding tax, it would be $0.929 or $0.93 rounded off. 

FYI: Other fast food places, like Carl's Jr., Popeyes 
and Arby's give seniors a 10% discount. Guess Culver's is a little 'cheap' in their discount. 

It's not the money. It the principal. A couple of dollars discount is not going to make any real difference in my life. 

If you're going to offer a senior discount, then you should give it gladly without an attitude, like this so called manager had. If Culver's doesn't REALLY want to offer a senior discount, just say so. Don't try to snooker seniors out of giving it. 

I called Culver's customer service number to comment on all this before writing this review. It goes to 'voicemail', so they don't even have a live, real person to take comments/complaints. 

All this is such a shame because they have really good food and shakes.

I guess I need to be a lot more assertive when ordering to make sure the counter person understands that I want the senior discount and watch to see it shows up on the order screen in front of me. 

Last time upon arriving home and realizing I didn't get my senior discount, I immediately called back and spoke to a  'manager'? I explained what had happened and told her which person it was that didn't give me my discount. She said she would talk to them about it. I didn't get a warm and fuzzy feeling she really meant it from the tone of her voice. That was the end of it. I thought she could have at least offered to give me the money for the discount if I brought my receipt back in next time I was there. But no, that didn't happen since they already had my money. 

It's not the money. It's the principle. If they offer this discount, then you should get it when you request it at the time you order your food. 

Last time I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. The chicken patty is oval shaped. They put ONE small slice of tomato on the sandwich that barely covers half the patty. This means you only have tomato on HALF of the sandwich. If you're going to offer tomato on your sandwiches, it should reasonably cover most of the meat/chicken....not half of it.

Five minutes tops, I thought. However, after I parked, some little dude on a high horse drove up and parked behind my car, blocking it in. He got out of his little black Honda or whatever, and I asked him if I could park here, to what he responded with a face shake saying no, then just said ""I'll move it in a sec."" with a familiar tone, as if I was his mother or something. Went into the shop and left me there waiting for him to move his car, when I could have just parked there, and gotten my sandwich while he went to do whatever he went in to do. Needles to say, he was rude and condescending. I understand that parking around the University is ridiculous, but the least he could've done as a ""customer service"" representative of Jimmy John's is say ""sorry no, you cannot,  but you could try parking here or there"" or something like that.

The salad I ordered and paid for was not in our bag, and unfortunately the soft drinks we ordered were very light in syrup. Not a very good meal and eating experience for our family.

Warning, taking your food home to South Reno, will not be as good as if you lived closer by. So I recommend Troy relocating his restaurant or you buy a new home. The BBQ ribs have a different bite. It's not your usual tasting bbq. I can't pin point it. While I love it, my wife not so much. Beef Brisket and bacon sandwich was yummy and huge! Finally a place that does brisket right.  Guess what blew me away though? His sides are limited and so I ordered baked beans and let me tell you... while not a fan of beans in general, these had to be the best BEANS I ever tasted! They had two different kinds of beans, meats and coarse grind black peppers that added some kick. I ate the whole thing! So you're probably wondering why only 4 stars and not 5? Presentation. The restaurant is a bit cluttered and disorganized. Troy is a great chef but he could use an interior designer.  There's random seating while you wait for food. Random tees for sale.

Great bbq. Great sauces! I got the brisket sammich and my brother got the ribs. The brisket sammich was delicious and was very generous on the meat.

Their sauces are great I didn't want to risk getting something to spicy so I tried the blue collar sauce. It was sweet and had a mild spice and was great with the brisket, they did give us their due rag sauce ( the spicier one) to try and I should have just order that. It was very good!

Being from Texas; I was sceptical but read all the great reviews. Walking in I tried to hassle the wonderfull lady at the counter. She expertly  ignored all the B.S. I shot her way; she looks back at the cooks and tells them ""they're new."" Tells me to follow her lead, so I recommended the waltz, then she said ""no the two step."" Thats when I knew I could trust her. She cracks a smile and serves us (three fellas) samples of brisket. AAAAHHH MAAA GOD!!!! The brisket was amazing. She recommended Sample plater and photos attached. Brisket was by far my top ten, loved the black crust. The brisket wasn't overbearingly greasy and very juicy. The pork ribs were sweet, delicious and O so tender. The pulled pork not my fave, but was clearly out shined by the other meats. Corn bread and all the sides a prefect fit.

Since you cannot eat there we left. I went to open my drink only to discover that it had expired in May 2016. Seriously!
Ok, on to the food. I opened up the sammich, which was good sized, the meat looked mushy.  One bite and that look was validated. The meat was cold with very little flavor. I love BBQ but I couldn't even finish this sammich.  
I then turned my attention towards the iron pot beans.  These were so hot you couldn't even eat them. I pushed through the heat to find, once again, very bland flavor. On to a favorite of mine, sweet cornbread.

22417,44,5,2017-08-11,"While there's very little seating in the joint it's certainly worth the drive to the entrance of Sun Valley if you've a hankering for excellent BBQ.  The work crew and I headed up there today (6 of us) for lunch.  Most ordered the Special - Brisket and Gravy (three buttermilk biscuits, gravy made from the drippings of the brisket and a thick cut of Brisket).  I opted for the Fitty-Fitty which is half pulled pork, half brisket and four dinner rolls.  

There are sides but none of us ordered them (or at least I don't think we did).  

Lunches were being delivered to us faster than we were ordering.  We fortunately found enough places to sit and everyone started digging in.

From my perspective the Brisket was perfectly done - it had a wonderful crust and was cooked juicy and tender, not dry and flavorless.  The Pulled Pork was also expertly done - rendered into shreds without any discernible fat left in the meat with just enough sauce added to the mixture to get it to the right consistency.  The hand made BBQ sauces were excellent as well but neither the Brisket or the Pork really needed sauce to complement/enhance their flavor/texture/moisture content.  There are three options for sauces on the table and others if you'd like to add more heat - just ask!

The portions on the plate were very generous.  The menu states that it's a half pound of either when ordered as a single item so I would presume that a fitty-fitty (which isn't listed on the menu) would be a quarter pound of each meat.  There was clearly more than that in the box I was served.  

One of our crew ordered one of the sandwiches and initially commented that he wished he'd been able to order fries.  After finishing it he retracted that statement adding that he couldn't have eaten them if they'd come with the sandwich.

Everyone else commented that they enjoyed their meal.  The proprietor and staff were friendly, conversational and humorous.  If you forced me to say something negative about this experience I'd have to say that when I said I wanted water with my lunch I was sold a bottle of water rather than offered a small glass with ice and water gratis.  Really not a big deal considering the mountain of food I was served and the cost of said mountain.

I found a screen panel you could order through, was very confusing but I got the hang of it and ordered, including what I wanted to drink (diet coke). Once I finished placing the order the panel asked me to take a V shape plastic sign that was next to the panel that had a number. The sign read something like - seat and we will bring you your order. A lady brought my order to the table but with no drink, then she said, I guess I should bring you a cup. Once she did I had to get up from the table to fill my cup with the diet coke (leaving my food behind). Once I got my drink I was able to finally eat! Maybe I didn't understand that I was supposed to get my own drink? but the panel asked me what I wanted to drink and the plastic sign told me to seat and wait for it all?",0,1,0,0

I have yet to find a place as good as my favorite spot in Texas.  Then I walk into Sparks & Smoke.  It's definitely a hole-in-the-wall mom & pop operation (a good indicator).  The cashier girl offers a sample of their brisket which I thought was unusual.  I've never heard of that happening, but I thought it was a great idea since I judge BBQ  joints on the quality of their brisket. The first bite into the huge sample was all I needed to know that I wanted more!!  As soon as I was done swallowing my first bite, I ordered the brisket plate.  Folks, that was some damn good brisket!!  Words can't describe how well each bite tasted. Or describe how I wanted more even though I was completely stuffed after finishing the 1/2 lb of that slow-smoked deliciousness.

When I was getting ready to leave, they asked how it was. Just a FYI, there is a swear jar in the joint.  And I knew my answer was going to cost me a dollar.  Before I answered, I put a dollar in and told them how great it was!!

22541,44,4,2018-08-04,"They have the best bbq brisket in town, which isn't saying much because Reno doesn't have great bbq.  Their brisket is decent though.  I've traveled the whole country trying bbq and I feel that I've gotten to the point where I can actually judge it.  

The brisket here is above average (on a country wide scale) but I've definitely had better.  It's fairly tender but its cut quite thick, which makes it seem tougher. It wasn't juicy but it wasn't dry either.  It had an average amount of smoke flavor, I personally prefer more smoke.  There was a thick rub on it which was flavorful but a little too salty.  The saltiness did not penetrate the meat much though, so I just made sure to include some crust in every bite.  Also it wasn't too fatty, nor was it too lean.  It was good both without and with sauce. Their sauces are average, but the spicy is barely spicy.

I had the brisket sandwich, which was very large and very reasonable.

To drink I had their home made sweet tea.  It was less sweet and less strong than most, but it was still pretty good.

They clearly put minimal effort in their sides though, because they were terrible.  Beans had almost no flavor, not sweet or salty at all, super bland.  Coleslaw was just chopped cabbage with maybe a little lemon.  I threw most of my sides away.

The dessert was delicious . It was an ooey gooey strawberry cake bar thing . It was very rich but very good.

22544,42,1,2016-10-10,"The saga continues...

This evening, the family wanted Popeyes for dinner.  As I walked out of the door, I drifted off into a fantasy that I would pull into the drive thru, make my order, not be told that I would have to wait 15 minutes for chicken, pay, receive said chicken within 2 minutes without being asked to pull up, or pull into the Chase Bank parking lot next door, and leave happy .

NO!!!!!!!!!!!!!

After being told that there was a 15 wait for mild chicken (I ordered an 8 piece), I told them ""that was fine"", and pulled up to pay.  To be honest, I wasn't upset about waiting for 15 minutes, as I was going to get fresh chicken.  After I payed, and they handed me the receipt, the Popeyes employee asked for it back.  I knew why he asked for it back... That's right, that damned timer!!! They wanted to wipe the order off of their pending order screen so they get credit for expediting the order in about 15 seconds.  

So, I was then directed to the Chase Bank parking lot to wait for my order along with another customer.  Adding the customer in front of the restaurant, there are now 3 of us that had to pull up.  The other 2 received their order in 15 minutes, and of course, I was forgotten about.  After walking up to the drive thru asking them where my order is, I observed 3 different parties go inside, order, and leave with s total of 4, 12 piece boxes.  Another 10 minutes goes by, and I finally receive my little 8-piece order, which was brought out by the Manager.

To top it all off, instead of receiving a simply apology, stating that I was forgotten about, the shift Manager proceeded to lie to me, which in the end, is the cataclysm of the overarching problem.  QUIT CHEATING THE TIMER SYSTEM!!!! The entire point of it is accountability.  Accountable to have fresh chicken on hand, expedite orders more efficient than the other stores in your district, and win awards based on your hard work and good management.  Cheating the system at the customer's expense should be unacceptable to all consumers.  

I would recommend to everyone that, when asked to pull up at any fast food restaurant, you put your vehicle in park.

Not naming other establishments, but I was convinced I would never eat good BBQ again if not from my own pits. 
I am glad to announce Sparks and Smoke have filled the void. The food was brought home as carry out and presented to me for evaluation.

Brisket.
Good flavor, good body and held up to the pull test. I do like my brisket a bit juicier, but considering this made a 24 mile journey before being served, it was pretty solid. *This is quite complimentary, given the delay. The person who picked it up (shall rename nameless) has since admitted to making another stop*

Beef ribs. 
Again, good flavor and super moist. I'd certainly get them again. 

Pork ribs. 
They were good. I'm not a fan of pork ribs in general and just make them for the rest of the folks. The kiddos declared them good, that's a win****

Sauces.
We don't use sauce in Central Texas ;)


Do not take this 4 Star rating lightly, I would not, will not and cannot even give my old stomping grounds folk Aaron Franklin a 5 Star rating. Not happening.

They had no bread and refused my 24 sandwich order b/c they needed 24 hour notice and they had already 3 other orders they had to fill.
So we asked to just order a dozen sandwiches to go. They had no bread!
Across the street was a Subway shop (not my first pick) but there stood the owner/operator Alicia before I could finish explaining our dilemma Alicia had 4 sandwich's done within 20 minutes I was packed up with 2 sandwich trays, a dozen cookies, 15 sodas. 

What was really cool was watching her (and her employee) flawlessly work my order and service the rest of her customers at the same time.

We made our lunch on time the sandwiches were a hit, everyone enjoyed our presentation and lunch.

Bottom line is we buy from people we like, people that you can depend on to get the job done. Alicia has earned our business and we will continue to buy from her every time we are in Reno.

If the tables are as dirty as they were, I can only imagine what diseases are incubating in that child play area!!!

Mc D's needs to take a lesson from the Quick Trip business model. No chairs for employees, no cell phones, clean, neat and courteous employees.

2. Samples. They offered us a beautiful cut of Brisket that was luscious. Nice bark, really juicy and not to smoky. 
I love brisket, but many folks dry it out. Not here.

3. Portion size. These guys give you huge portions. 1/2 pound of brisket , 1/2 pound of pulled pork. The ribs were falling off the bone including the beef ribs.

22612,44,5,2017-07-05,"What makes a great BBQ joint suddenly become excellent? The PEOPLE. And that's exactly what this place is all about: great people serving great food to hungry folks. As the name implies, most of the business coming through here is take-out, if only because there's not a ton of sitting room in the spot itself. However, somehow, they still manage to put forth the hospitality of a full-service restaurant.

Calling in my order was quick and easy - the woman on the other end of the line was friendly and patient with me as I asked a million questions about their daily special (pulled pork tater tot nachos.) When I came in to pick it up, there were 2 guys in the back and one woman at the register. This is a family-run joint and everyone is hilarious, witty, and so very welcoming. I got to try a sample of their AMAZING brisket and OH NO I NEED THIS IN MY LIFE Gooey Butter Cake. The brisket was absolutely heaven and I will of COURSE be returning for it. I actually had to take a piece of the cake to go this time around.

As for the pulled pork tater tot nachos: they are pretty much everything you would imagine with a name like that: tater tots smothered in a ridiculous amount of pulled pork, some BBQ sauce, a crazy amount of melted cheese, jalepenos, olives, and sour cream. Though the tots were not as crispy as I usually like them, the pork was succulent and flavorful and made the entire dish. I called it quits after eating 1/4 of it - though I would've finished the whole thing had I found the room in my belly to do so.

Additionally - they have a TON of different BBQ sauces - though the hottest one I tried had to be served out of a dropper bottle and it was pretty intense. I know that was on the lower scale of spicy though, so grubber beware!

The pictures that people have posted on Yelp are pretty much right on target. The sauce is in bottles on the counter so you pick your own and they had some crazy names but I like the sweet one best.

We said no and she immediately told the kitchen and they cut us two generous pieces of brisket to try. Very tasty.

It is take out but they have about 10 stools inside with counter seating. The inside is very basic and conventional with smart alecky decor (My kind of place). But hey, they do BBQ not interior design. 

I ordered the brisket sammich with wet doo rag bbq sauce and my wife ordered the pulled pork tots. The food came out in a timely fashion, packaged to go.

The Brisket is so good, you don't even need sauce but their sauces are special too and our favorite was the hot doo-rag version. Unlike some joints that make it hot for the sake of being hot, this one was hot and tasty.

We tried the side of kettle beans and they were pure awesomeness inspired by the Hill Country of Texas.

The pancakes were quite good, although you could argue that pancakes are in the Top Ten of comfort foods that are very difficult to mess up.

Complimented by a hot, fresh, crispy side of hash browns, it was a very satisfying breakfast for a minimal price.

I'll update it later after I try a few more items.

22700,43,1,2019-01-02,"It's bad. So, so bad. I go there almost exclusively at night, and that's where the problems are. They opened up a second line for the drive thru, and it's still only got one person taking the orders. It's really hard to concentrate on giving your order when you've got a homeless person rapping on your car window, and you can hear someone in the other line screaming ""Hello? HELLO???""

It doesn't matter if there's no cars or 10 cars in front of you, you're still going to be here a minimum of 20 minutes. They forget to put sauces in the bag, they forget what you ordered and ask you to verify at the second window, they forget straws, they give the wrong change, it's all just wrong. You can order something at the box, and by the time you get to the window, they'll tell you that they're sold out, or the machine is broken. Despite the extremely long wait times, the food NEVER tastes fresh. The hamburger meat will be spongy, the chicken nuggets will be dry and greasy, the french fries are cold, the ice cream is runny. It's like they make order #5 before order #1, so order #1 has to wait forever, and order #5's food is awful.

I've been there during the day, and they're usually okay - I don't know if it's better staff, or more staff working at the time, or luck, but the difference is literally like day and night. I just went there tonight because my mom was craving a burger, and we waited 40 minutes for 2 cheeseburgers and 2 pies. While I was ordering, the girl kept asking her coworker questions or tapping away at a second computer. After 25 minutes of waiting, a homeless man came to the window and stared in at me for a solid 5 minutes. 5 more minutes later, the girl working the register asked me what I ordered, then told me they were out of pies.

Overall, I think the problem is most likely that they don't staff enough people... Some of the employees do try to make it better. They apologize for the wait, they offered me an extra dessert since they were out of pies, the problem is that they just don't seem to have enough staff to go around. One person seemed to be taking the orders of both drive-thru lines AND the inside, while someone else was trying to hand food out and window, make fries, AND run food out to cars. It was like they had 3 staff and a manager, and they need 4 or 5 staff. I'd give 1.5 stars if I could, only because some of the employees do try to help you, but the bad experiences FAR outnumber the good.",1,0,0,0

22702,44,4,2016-09-16,"I could already smell the smoke as I parked my car at Sparks Smoke and BBQ Takeout. For some, wood smoke may evoke warnings of wildfire or structures in peril, but my brain leaps to thoughts of meaty goodness cooked, ""low and slow."" I was almost drooling with anticipation when I collected my order, and the drive home was truly torturous. 

I firmly believe you can't go wrong if you stick with your strengths, and this family-operated business is doing exactly that. The available meats include pulled pork and beef brisket--available as sandwiches, plates, or by the pound--as well as St. Louis-style ribs. I hear they have occasionally have beef ribs, so call ahead. Sweet Hawaiian-style rolls are used for sandwiches, but I was focused on getting a mess o' meat and a couple sides.

There are many good ways to do ribs; I don't ascribe to a be-all-end-all method. I personally prefer them tender-yet-still-hanging onto the bone, with just enough that I have to give a little tug with each bite. But for folks who love 'em best when completely falling off the bone, Sparks and Smoke is your huckleberry. I actually held a rib by one end--gave it a little shake--and the meat fell easily onto the plate. The rub had good flavor on its own, but the addition of housemade sauces turned good into great ($25, full rack).

Three housemade sauces are available, ""White Collar"", ""Blue Collar"", and ""Mop Sauce"". The first is sweet without any spice to speak of. The second has similar sweetness, but with more vinegar and black pepper. The last sauce had just enough kick to make my palate sing without too much fire. Sauce is included with every order, or you can buy a 16oz squeeze bottle to take home for $8.50.

Having home-smoked my share of 'que, I can attest to the skill required to get beef brisket just right. Without enough attention to temperature and smoke, it's tough and near-inedible. Too much time or temp, and it's best used for stew. This beef is right in the Goldilocks zone--tender, smoky, and moist--served with fat trimmed to a minimum. The smoke is perfect, the bark terrific; slather on some sauce and you've got heaven on a plate. ($18, 1lb)

The pulled pork--tender and moist, with nice bark and plenty of smoke--was just a tad overshadowed by the other meats ($16 per pound). It paired very well with the coleslaw, a beguilingly subtle combination of cabbage, carrot, green apple, vinegar, mustard, and black pepper that was neither soupy or overly sweet. I added a couple shakes of salt and gobbled it down with the pork ($4, 16oz).

A side of iron pot beans turned out to be a mix of pinto and Great Northern beans, cooked until creamy in texture, with a chunk of brisket for flavor. They were a nice change from the more typical sweet baked beans and ranch-style chili beans usually served with barbecue, though--as with the slaw--I did add dash of salt ($4.50 16oz).

My wife is a big fan of cornbread. Though I appreciate it, I let her be the judge of what is and isn't good. Her verdict on this example: good corn flavor, not too dry, and the right balance of sweetness ($4). I thought the serving size was a bit small for the money, but perhaps that's just because it's not my favorite.",1,0,0,0

I told them it was dry and gritty. I just mentioned it to them so that they can do something about it and to keep the quality on high standard.

Words can't convey how good perfection, except maybe the F-Bomb, because they have swear jar there to take collection when you sample the brisket and blurt out ""OMFG.""  

If the taste didn't prove that this father/son duo was passionate about their product, then a friendly chat with either surely will.  These guys love what they do and love to share it with you.

Also, grab a slice of grandma's gooey cake for later; it goes well with leftovers.",1,0,0,0

The girl behind the counter, (I believe her name was Jennie) was glued to her phone and didn't even realize I was there. The other older lady was in the back, cutting some veggies, it looked like. At least she was doing something. As I was standing there waiting to place my order, she gave me a dirty look and just stood there staring at me and didn't say a word until I started ordering.  She was very rude, and was rushing me the whole way. My sandwich was VERY sloppy and the bread was hard as a rock, mushy tomatoes and the lettuce was brown! So much for ""Eat Fresh"". I asked if I could get different lettuce and she said that's all they had. REALLY?! That's all you have to serve to your customers?! When it was time to pay, I asked for a cup for water which then she proceeded to say, ""Are you really going to use it for water?"", which I thought was very rude!

Good thing, because I wasn't a fan of their mild sauce. Medium was better, but I ate my brisket plain, and it was delicious just like that. Beans weren't quite what I was expecting, but they were good. Just needed some salt, but that's a super easy fix. Better not enough than too much. Today's gooey butter cake was red velvet. It was good, just not as sweet as I'm used to with butter cake. All and all, I think this is a solid BBQ joint with a very basic menu. A few things done well. No need for 20 choices.

22785,50,1,2019-07-26,"Okay. Hello my name is Joshua and I went and picked up food after work that I ordered and paid for it online about 30 minutes before pickup. Once I got to the restaurant, I went to the pick up online and I was greeted by Fran. I told him my name and he told me that it was gonna be a little bit of a wait. With the experience in a fast food environment I understood and expected that. Then as my order was being prepped I kept seeing Fran and a woman about as tall as him talking and from what it looked like they were disagreeing with something that may of happened earlier. Then the woman kept rolling her eyes and calling for items to the kitchen stuff that were actually working. Odd. I found it a little odd as well that Fran was prepping my utensils so late when the food was virtually done. So after what I thought was gonna be a 5 minute stop and go pick up, I ended up waiting 10-15 minutes for my order to be complete that I ordered a half an hour before pick up. I understand that fast food places get slammed. I almost know it all too well but 30 minutes in advance leaves little excuse to be acceptable. So after I got my food I decided to check it. Everything was good, except the walnut shrimp being half full. A premium item, half full. If it was any other item I would probably let it slide but I don't pay extra to have it half assed. So that's the reason for my rating. That a fast food worker named Fran moving slowly and a woman throwing attitude and clearly frustrated and kept jawing with Fran. Let alone it's a fast food place that makes 11 dollars an hour....what? The service I felt like I got was 7.25 at best. Please take this review into consideration. I left a fast food restaurant to go into a better environment/pay and I get service from someone who makes 11 dollars an hour and got a 7.25 dollar an hour response. I don't want free food (but it'd be nice) but I want those who make more then 10 to actually do their job correctly. The woman also needs some time off or not work quite as much because her attitude makes it hard to enjoy the family friendly atmosphere that I know Panda Express gives. Have a great night. Don't half ass a premium item and work hard. Thank you.",1,0,0,0

I've visited Sparks and Smoke twice before, so this review reflects a combination of my experience.

My first time here I purchased a half-rack of ribs and some brisket, and from what I can remember of the food it was all great. I wouldn't claim that any of the food was the best I've had, or even on that level, but they scratched my itch for sure. Plus they have a hot BBQ sauce that is pretty tastey, and their sides (read cornbread here) are great.

Unfortunately, last week I ran here right after work and had a different experience. It was 4pm on a Tuesday and they told me that they were already out of ribs. To say I was disappointed is an understatement, but the gal at the counter told me that next time I should call ahead and make sure to reserve some. 

My experience with the food I got instead didn't do much for my mood. I ordered the brisket and pulled pork in lieu of the ribs. My, what a dissapointment the brisket was. While it had the beautiful char around the edge, it was sadly dry in the inside. The pulled pork on the other hand wasn't terrible, but it kinda lost its texture in a bit of a soft mess.

This location was recently ""updated"" to look like some of the older locations that were razed and rebuilt to keep up with the new cutting edge look of fast fooderies, but they can't fool me.  I've been in there too much.  The proprietor's cheap remodel barley masks the blight of this 40 year old BK.

Lunch time on a Saturday, and there were 3 people working.  The manager was working the drive-thru, a young, socially awkward girl was working the cash register and one kid was non-nonchalantly making the food.  It took forever to get our shit, and when we did it was colder than our one Florida day of winter.

The soda station was a disaster area.  Probably because there were only three people working, and no one had time to clean it up or restock lids and straws.

The meat was mild and smoky with a subtle sweetness. The macaroni and cheese was decadent. The sourdough was indeed sour. Topped with their house made BBQ sauces it was an absolute delight to consume. The folks running Sparks and Smoke were courteous and polite, downright helpful in fact.

The small loaf of corn bread was tasty, just a bit soft so it fell apart, not a big deal.  They offer sour cream and cheese with the chili, as well as honey and butter for your corn bread.

The coleslaw isn't the normal mayonnaise laden slaw, it's flavorful and seems more vinegar based which I really enjoyed. The cornbread and sweet tea were also good. The sauces are unique, more peppery than spicy with just the right amount of sweetness.

I got instructions on how to reheat dinner but they also packaged everything so it would warm up in the best way to retain its flavor and juiciness.

The sample brisket I received after telling them it was my first time was delicious.  I spent 5 years in Texas and I cook excellent brisket myself, but this put my own to shame.  It is delicious and I'm fond of telling folks that you can judge a BBQ place by its brisket.  

The ribs were very tender and also delicious.  They have 3 sauces you can choose from based on preferred spice level.  They are not your usual BBQ sauce, very good, and I'm excited to try a more spicy version next time.

The undressed beans were a little bland, but still tasty, which (as stated above, is perfect for my babies).  Add a little sauce to taste or just get them sauced and they are extremely good.  The cornbread was basic, but not dry.  I'm excited to try more things.

He went over to his neighbor's house and asked the guy if he could teach him how to smoke meats. The gentleman responded, if you can keep the temperature between here and here, and watch it for 24 hours, I will teach everything I know. Little did Troy know that the salmon he was smoking would lead to a restaurant in Reno.
Fast forward a couple years and Sparks and Smoke BBQ was born. Opened in April of ,2016, this restaurant is located right off of clearacre.
Parking is plentiful, and the restaurant is easy to find.

When you walk in you are greeted with a loud welcome. This is a family run business, with his two sons working there, and they make you feel like part of the family.
I really did not know what to order, so I asked what do you suggest? Out came samples of brisket. Not many places will do that, the brisket was delicious.
I ordered the special of the day, a potato loaded with brisket, bacon, cheese, butter and sour cream. OMG!!!!
I also had a side of beans and cornbread. Both were delicious.

22899,44,4,2020-01-01,"We purchased a very large takeout order for my dad's birthday as a surprise. I'd heard their brisket is the best in town and had to try it.
Let me preface this experience by saying we're all from Texas, and have some pretty high standards for bbq.
The service was incredible. Everyone was so nice and they threw in a few extra things that really made the meal for us. We had nice size samples of all their bbq sauces - which all had amazing and different flavors.
The current location is very small with a few red/white checkered covered tables - very casual. Easy to miss the storefront as it's tucked in a small shopping center. I'm excited to see their new place next year!
I was disappointed they didn't offer sausage, as it's one of my dad's favorites. We ordered: brisket, pork ribs, pulled pork, potato salad, and an assortment of desserts. They waited until we picked up the order before slicing the brisket which was awesome. 
We asked for lean and also more marbled brisket. The lean was definitely a lot drier, as it usually is, and chewy. The flavor was good but we were a little disappointed in exactly how dry both brisket choices were. The ""slices"" of brisket were also huge and we needed cutlery to eat it. It was good, just didn't quite meet our expectations (again, which are probably overly high). 
My husband loved the pork ribs, but I found them to be missing something. They were very tender and juicy. Dipping them in the different bbq sauces made them better in my opinion.
We all loved the pulled pork. We made mini sliders with them with little yeast rolls. In the restaurant they have an option for hawaiian sweet rolls - which sounds great too.
The potato salad was exactly what we expected. No frills but very good.
The desserts were 3 flavors of the same kind of cake. Super dense and very rich. If I remember correctly these are made with a cake mix bottom layer, and then a cream cheese layer on top. So we had red velvet, gooey butter?, and maybe a lemon one. Where we all liked the cake, it was just so rich we only had a couple bites of each.

2 Adults

Atmosphere - 3 stars
Food - 3 stars
Service - 5 stars

Background - Heading out for a day of shopping and needed some fuel.

Atmosphere - ""Get Yer Food and GET OUT!!!"" reads the receipt.  Their name ends with Takeout.  So the place is basic in every sense.  Their office is very visible when you walk in.  We did stay to eat and they have some counter tops along the windows.

Food
  Drink - I had bottled water, if you go with the ones on the right side of the fridge they are free.

  Sample - As we walked in the door we were welcomed and asked if we had been there before.  Nope, and a piece of brisket was brought out for both of us by the cook.  The meat was great.  I should over ordered the brisket.

  Lunch - Thursday special is the beef rib, well since it was Thanksgiving I think it moved to this Saturday.  So we each ordered a rib each.  I was not a fan of them, the silver back was still on them, and had to be pulled off by hand before you could even start.  Trying to use my plastic fork to pull meat off the bone almost broke the fork.  The amount of salt in the rub was too much.  The sauces were too sweet, even the sweet big pepper bite.  My wife also had order the cole slaw, which neither of us where fans of.

Service - Warm greeting with a free sample is always great service.  Fair after that.  After we ordered at the register I had wait until the meat was weighed.   We sat and waited until our food was ready to be served and paid at that point.

Future - Maybe to try that brisket again.",1,0,0,0

The beans were pretty good, not amazing. Then came those slabs, which I can only imagine came down from the non-existent heaven. Pure black on the outside, similar color to my atheist heart. A slightly pinkish brown on the inside, indicating pure moisture.

22965,44,2,2020-02-21,"Well, I was hoping to really like this place given all the 5-star reviews and the label ""Best BBQ in Nevada"". But, frankly, I found it to be very disappointing. Maybe they were having a bad day...I'll try them again some other time just to make sure.

I got the Sampler Plate with bones so I was able to taste most everything they offer. The Sampler includes Pulled Pork, Brisket, and Ribs. I also ordered cole slaw as a side dish. I'm not sure where you're from, but back east where I'm from, virtually everybody puts cole slaw on a pulled pork sandwich -- Here on the West coast, they want to cover everything in cheese. No self-respecting southerner would even consider such sacrilege! Fortunately, Sparks and Smoke didn't offer cheese!

In my opinion, everything was overcooked and generally tasteless. In addition, the brisket was way too salty. The cole slaw was really nothing more than some chopped up cabbage and carrots without much liquid or spices to add flavor.

I also got the ""medium"" BBQ sauce. It was ""OK"" but didn't have much noteworthy flavor. It was also a bit too runny for my taste.

Finally, I went in at lunch time on a Friday and it was very busy. However, it took over 1/2 hour to get the food for carry-out. This I don't understand because everything they offer is pre-cooked so all they have to do is warm and package the food. One more thing. They only offer beef ribs once a month for some reason.

In fairness, the lady behind the counter who took my order was very nice and forewarned me that they were running ""a bit behind"". In fact, she was probably the only positive part of the meal.

I realize they just moved to this location but there is no signage of any kind -- not even a piece of paper in the window or over the door. Parking, too, was very difficult.

22966,44,4,2021-06-05,"The good: clean place, friendly service, generous portions. The meat was incredibly tender and well-smoked. Both ribs and brisket were falling apart in the best way. Pickles were great, cornbread was better than most BBQ restaurants, but not the best.

The bad: the rub on the brisket had a briney, ocean-like saltiness to it. Not a lot of flavor besides salt there, and it's too bad because, again, the meat was so well-prepared. 

The meh: the Mac and cheese was nothing to write home about. The noodles were disintegrating, and the cheese sauce was grainy. Also didn't care for the BBQ sauces (mild and medium) because they mainly tasted of vinegar with not much else. The meat was moist enough that it really didn't require any sauce anyway.

In conclusion: I would love to come back and get the ribs. The rub on the brisket was just too salty, and I don't see ordering it again. They get the hardest part of BBQ right: the cook, but some of the seasonings and accompaniments needed tweaking.",1,0,0,0

I get to the window, the girl does not greet me but reaches her hand out the window to grab my card and gives me my food. I noticed we were missing cream cheese rangoons, so I stayed at the window and said very politely that they were missing from my order.

""They're not even on your order. Show me your receipt"" then she sees I have the bigger plate which is 3 entrees and a side, and I said well I did order and pay for a bigger plate so we'd like a third entree. She woman continued to say with the drive through window open ""did she actually get a bigger plate?"" Finally I just said, please just give us an egg roll or whatever is equivalent to the cream cheese rangoons and it's fine.

We get to our food, and the chow mein was so dry and tasted so old that we did not eat it, and we kept getting big (sized like pieces of orange chicken) chunks of not sure what but seemed like the breading or batter that goes on the orange chicken. 
She also did not include any sauces, or fortune cookies.

22982,44,4,2020-06-04,"First time here on 6-2-20
Was met by Jeremy whom described the menu and the awards along with how he focuses on his brisket which he claimed to be a winner.

I ordered 1/2 pound of pork and 1/2 pound of brisket.  Also got a side of beans and cole slaw.  Jeremy discussed how he made the cole slaw with vinegar  and apples so I was eager to try it.  I've traveled to 48 states and have eaten many cuisines including BBQ in Texas and North Carolina so I know what's good and Jeremy agreed to that during our conversation.

Here's my review on what I ordered:
Pulled pork:  Excellent, really good flavor, a little sweetness to it, very moist.  Very surprised at how good this was.
Beef brisket:  Not much flavor except where the rub was, a little dry but the sauce added some flavor.  Surprised because Jeremy hyped it up so much.
Cole slaw:  Dry, bland, could not taste vinegar nor apples.  Disappointed.
Beans:  WOW!  Flavors burst in my mouth, the pepper stood out and the pieces of meat were an added bonus.  I would go back just for the beans.
Sauces:  All were good especially the hot sauce.  I'm not big on hot sauces but this one didn't set my mouth on fire and still had a little bite to accent the meats.

Overall, I wasn't blown away by the food but I may go again and try more items and get a better feel for the menu.",1,0,0,0

The workers are always friendly but just not super fast - if there's a line, expect to be there a while. I've worked in fast food so I know the value of everyone having their specific jobs, but I feel like they're constantly understaffed to the point that everyone is trying to do multiple jobs that are just unrelated. (For example, cooking in the back while also trying to help with the line up front. Logistically this just won't work out.) You can tell though that this is by design, they're doing what they were trained to do - so absolutely no fault to the employees. Since they're understaffed in the kitchen and on the front line, that leaves much to be desired in the cleanliness of the rest of the restaurant because they clearly don't have time. It isn't a complete disaster, but it's also not Grade A cleaning material.

Usually brisket is not my favorite meat when we get bbq, but after trying it, I had to get more. This is some life-changing stuff! We split the brisket plate and got a side of coleslaw and beans.  We enjoyed the coleslaw, which was crisp and delicious. The beans were a nice change from the standard baked beans that most places have.  We sat at the counter and enjoyed trying the different varieties of bbq sauces-they were all tasty, but the spicy one was our favorite.  I checked into yelp to get a slice of gooey butter cake, which was amazing and rich. Then to wash everything down, we had a couple delicious sweet teas.

Dish out the food to your own dishes and glasses, then bag up all the take-out containers for disposal, sanitize your sink area, and remember to wash your hands before eating! Okay, now to the actual food. The best things at Popeyes are their chicken and shrimp, and of course their Buffalo dip. I've never really found their sides all that appealing, and the biscuits are decent but sometimes taste a little burnt. Still, the chicken and shrimp are really tasty, especially if you have a hankering for something breaded and fried. The chicken strips are always tender in the middle and not overdone, and really, can you get fried shrimp for such a low price anywhere else at a drive through?

Went to this location yesterday evening around 6:45 p.m. actually it started off at Freddy's and they were extremely busy so we walked over to the Arby's location which was dead there was no cars. And there was no people in the lobby.. when walking in the lobby had trash paper towels straw wrappers on the ground and a few of the tables had not been cleaned off there was a worker lounging in one of the seats I'm guessing she was on break. Went to the front counter and no one waited on us for two or three minutes, we then got waited on gave her order was handed are soda cups and I got ready 2 get my sauces which then found out the sauce and cops were all over the counter and the sauce head run-out. Went to ask for three different types of sauce and was handed one type, and is that nine of them mind you I only had one sandwich. While they were making the sandwiches I noticed the au ju for our other sandwich had run out of the container and the worker was pouring the bottom of the container into a cup. When we sat down to eat looked at our sandwiches and could tell that they had been microwaved. The au ju juice hadbeen burned and it was chunky in the container. My sandwich was definitely not what the picture look like on the display. The french fries were scraped from the very bottom so we there were little teeny tiny parts of french fries and they were ice cold. While we we're eating heard at the workers talking about how they had been to Roxy's the club and was being very graphic about it, definitely not a discussion that a customer needed to know. This location is very unprofessional, the food is subpar. This location needs to clean not only the inside but the outside as well there were trash and papers astrew in the parking lot. The bathroom had toilet paper on the ground and definitely was not very sanitary looking. The soap in the container had no soap whatsoever, that is telling me that the workers are not washing their hands after using the bathroom.

I placed a mobile order on 12/30/20 for a Quarter Pounder with Cheese and a few other items.  Did the mobile order and payment before showing up at the restaurant.  As the mobile curbside pickup was closed I had to pick up my order in the drive thru.  I gave the lady my mobile order number and I was directed to proceed to the first window.

So, I approached the first window and gave her my order number.  She insisted on giving me a receipt even though I already received one via email as part of the McDonald's mobile ordering app.  I politely insisted that I did not need a receipt - instead the lady (a young black lady) got very aggressive and said otherwise.  Then the lady decided to slap me on my left shoulder with the receipt in hand for no reason whatsoever; what that lady did to me was an act of battery.

I went to the second window to pick up my order.  I spoke to the manager on duty and explained what happened.  Was advised that the manager would speak to the lady that processed my mobile order at the first window and I left.  That lady at the first window had better count her lucky stars that I did not decide to press criminal charges of battery against her.

That being said, I will not return to this McDonald's restaurant at least until this employee is counseled about her actions to say the least or the employee is terminated from employment.  Touching or striking a customer is definitely bad customer service on the part of both McDonald's and its franchise owner.",0,1,0,0

The flavor is incredible: it still tastes fresh and still has a good amount of that delicious sticky meat flavor, and it's beautifully seasoned.  

The sauce is delicious, and you can put it on just about anything, (I'd be perfectly happy just using it with fries instead of ketchup, or just onions) but honestly the brisket doesn't even need it because it's so good on its own.

I ordered  based on the Yelp ratings, and was surprised to find it was the same place.  The front three sides are wrapped in glass, and I had trouble finding the door, which is on the left side when facing the building.  The interior looked clean, which it should anyway, but especially when fully visible from outside, 180°.

The pizza was good, but not especially so.  The pepperoni could have had a little more of a punch, the sausage was crumbled a bit small for my textural preference, and the pie was a little bit salty.  Good crust, though.  I've definitely had worse.

I also ordered a plain cheesesteak, which I liked a lot.  There was a lot of meat and just enough cheese, served on a soft roll that held up exceedingly well.  It was pretty much all anyone could ask for.

Now the cons: a bit on the pricey side. $4.00 for a slab of cornbread. I didn't try it because of the price, and I love cornbread, but to me a piece of cornbread worth $4.00 is larger than I want to eat with a meal. Portions are large, 1/2# of brisket, 1/2# of pulled pork. I don't want to eat portions that large, please offer something smaller. My friend, who has a healthier appetite than I do, had the Brisket sandwich and enjoyed it but took home part of it because he couldn't finish it. I had the pork spare ribs. The smallest order is for a half rack which is more than I usually eat. They should make 1/4 rack available.

We heard the shift manager yelling at her people about a breakfast order.  There were numerous problems and all pointed to the fact that the shift manager lost control of her people and the situation.

I've been waiting for Thursday for a while because only on this day does Sparks and Smoke BBQ offer these huge beef ribs as their special. I just had to make it to this special occasion. I'm so happy I could cry right now, lol. Not really, but for reals though, I haven't had a beef rib this flavorful since my last visit to Houston Texas a few years ago. This rib was so flavorful I wouldn't even bother to put any sauce on. It was perfectly smoked and flavored. I ordered one bone and received a 1.25 lb. huge beef rib! It looked intimidating but 15 min  after I'd come to find that my appetite is much bigger than I look. I polished the whole thing off. I had their beans too, some corn bread with butter and honey and washed it down with some sweet ice tea to complete my Texas fantasy. What can I say, beans are on point, they are not the sweet kind and I love this. Corn bread is soft and delicious. Cole slaw, which I had last week is nice and crispy, not your everyday mushy slaw drenched in a sweet mayo.
I left the place pretty satisfied with my experience and I'll definitely hit this place up again. Every one that works here is very respectful and friendly. It's nice to see smiling faces as you walk in the door.

While looking at the menu, we were asked if we had been there before, to which we said no.  We were provided a sample of their brisket.  The sample has roughly the size of two bites, moist, flavorful and had a nice strip of fat.
We really came in to get their Saturday special (Brisket Chili), which we were given a sample of.  Another dish that did not disappoint.  We ended up ordering the brisket plate ($10.50 with sauce on the side) and the chili/cornbread (with cheese and sour cream (not charged for the addons)) combination ($9.00), and a slice of chocolate butter cake to split between the two of us.  
While waiting for our order, I talked with a very nice gentleman (which I assume to be the owner) regarding his chili and entering it into the local competitions.  He pointed to his wall where there was an award for peoples choice winner 2017.
We brought the food home and to be honest, two orders of chili or a single order of the brisket plate would have been enough food for the two of us to split.

Here's the rub! Get it?

I've eaten at some of the most fabled BBQ joints in all the land, and Troy Donson and his team at Sparks and Smoke make THE BEST beef brisket and beef ribs I have ever had the pleasure of putting in my mouth! 

The brisket is TEXTBOOK perfection with a solid, well seasoned bark, deep fully rendered fatty richness that cannot be compared to any other. The beef ribs are MASSIVE, like dinosaur sized, only available on Thursdays and as incredibly succulent, smoky, rich and delicious as the brisket. You cannot go wrong with either of these meats when you visit.

Sauce is on the side here, AS IT SHOULD BE! But you want some because the tangy sweetness is the necessary foil to the fatty richness they've worked so hard to produce. I use the tiniest amount and dip my bites individually. The names are hilarious too and I still haven't figured out which is my fave.

Carbs? They got em. Cornbread (delicious) an Ooey Gooey Butter Cake for dessert! If you're into the sweets, that's a don't skip! 

On top of that, this team is as fun, quirky and genuine in real life as they lead on to be via their social media! They truly treat each guest as a friend, or better yet, part of the family and want you to have an incredible experience. 

So why four stars?
This may be a point of personal preference, but I am not a fan of their pork ribs or pulled pork, or their sides. Sides just need some seasoning and they'll be rocking. The beans are cooked perfectly and have BIG ASS (technical term) pieces of that fabulous brisket in em, bringing a delightful smokiness, but beyond that they are bland. Coleslaw is about the same. It's not mayo based and needs more punch. 

Bottomline, RUN TO SPARKS AND SMOKE! The brisket is the real deal, as are the beef ribs, and either is reason enough for to visit and give five stars. 

But knowing my friends there they want the real rub (there it is again) so I'm sharing the specifics.",1,0,0,0

As for the food I tried the Baconator combo ($2.00 off w/ app) w/ Seasoned Fries/Wedges, & Frosty...ccino, plus the Honey Butter Chicken Biscuit (free w/ any purchase on app).

The Baconator was as good as its hype.  Be prepared for a little heat though...in the sausage.  It was a breakfast in itself.

I generally don't like, or eat, biscuits...just me.  The chicken w/ the honey butter topping was excellent.

I liked the texture of the Wedges but didn't care for the seasoning, e.g. garlic, cummin, ugh.  Also, I love coffee, & I love Wendy's Chocolate Frosties, but the combination of the two (Frosty ...ccino) was much less than its parts.

My son ordered some chicken and biscuit sandwiches, his with pepper jack and mine with bacon. My first bite, I lost track of what was being said in a movie and it took me a while to get the hang of tasting it plus doing other things. It was that good! 

The biscuit was lovely and soft, the chicken was crunchy enough to be crunchy'esque, but, not hard to  eat at all. The bacon was just the right amount of crispy. Frying had obviously occurred, but, greasiness and sloppiness were not present.  It was one of the most pleasant experiences I have had with chicken

It made me feel like I wasted a lot of time not ordering from Chick-FIl-A ! People kept telling me that maybe I would like the food, but, since it is so expensive, I might like ... numerous other places ... better. Most of which have the same sort of price and, regardless of price, far less satisfying fare. 

Also, it tasted much healthier than commercial fried chicken ever has before.",1,0,0,0
23085,56,2,2016-03-16,"First off, I'm only giving two stars because of the nice delivery driver. Second, I love Jimmy John's. It's a somewhat healthy alternative for people who need to have food delivered that isn't pizza or super greasy. With that being said, I love that they deliver to my place of work on days I don't have my car or forget my lunch. I've ordered from this location three times. They have forgotten my drink all three times. The delivery guy from today when this happened was actually quite nice about the situation and told me that he was going back for my coke and was going to throw in a free cookie. It did take a while for my food to get here, so I missed my lunch break. It took over thirty minutes. So that was a bummer. I even called up to the store to check on my food and there was a girl who answered and I heard her say ""oh my god, it's rothman."" By that point, I didn't know about them forgetting my drink. Some guy named Matt gets on the phone and all I said was hey I was just checking on my food and he said it will be there soon there was just two other deliveries ahead of me. That's fine. I said okay, I was just calling to check and thanked them. They neglected to tell me oh by the way we didn't send the delivery guy with your drink that you paid for but your order is on its way. I also just want to say I put no blame on the delivery guy. That's not his fault. There was attitude from the Matt guy and whoever the girl was. That's unprofessional and customer service should be important to any establishment. I'm allowed to check on my food if it's been a long time and the location is less than two miles away. Come on, there's no need to groan about it or act like I'm inconveniencing you when I paid for the food and one) It took forever to get and two) you didn't even give me all of my order. That's not cool. I won't order from this location anymore because I feel uncomfortable with the whole ordeal and how I was treated. It's absolutely ridiculous.

He says very rudely, ""I told you to hold on"".  First of all you didn't tell me to hold on, and 2nd of all, there are nicer ways of being. Finally he asked to take my order, and I tell him I have an app code for $4 for a McDouble, a 4 pc nugget, a small fries and a small drink.. He says you don't give the app code until after you reach the window. I told him, ""the morning crew just takes my app code and it already tells them what I am ordering just by the code alone"". I could hear him sighing as if my informing him of what the app says was annoying him. Against my better judgement, I continue ordering the McDouble, a 4 pc nugget, a small fries and a small drink. When I get to the window, I provide the 4 digit code and he tells me the total is $7.62, I said ""Sir, the app says those 4 things for $4. He said ""I don't run the app, I just punch in the numbers"". I said ""well thats wrong!"" He said, ""Do you just want your money back?"" At this point I was already frustrated with the whole ordeal and said ""You know what, YES! and also can I speak to your manager?"", to which he replied, ""I am the manager"".

Once we placed our order an early 30's black male eating his food yelled out to me and I could not hear what he was saying. I asked him to repeat and still could not understand him. I decided to approach him and then he says to me ""You speak for Donald Trump don't you"". I said what are you talking about? He said this again and then he said I heard you speaking about persecution. I looked at him and said no I did not. He said your a F#CK!nG Liar! I told him he was F#cking crazy. I went to the front counter and informed the employee at the counter and she just had a blank look and did not respond. My wife wanted to take the food home so we walked towards the door when the manager was right behind us and also informed her and she had no response. I told this man that I do support the blue and he told me to Fu#K Off! Great time to lose business and we will never go back to this location and our word of mouth will travel everywhere that we can inform people about this location. Pretty sad being accused of a full out lie while minding our own business. Never again! Wish my wife would have video taped this but does not matter I will never back down from any false accusations.

In the absence of side-by-side comparison in the annual Nugget barbecue cook off, I don't know if flavor would place first, but it would easily rank among leaders.  I recommend using their original (described as medium heat) sauce on ribs as well as beef brisket/ great flavor, not too sweet. The mild flavor sauce may suit many, but I found it bland. Thier ""hot"" flavor bbq sauce is not really strongly spicy, is also very good. However, original remains a safer choice of guests include people with low spice tolerance.

They were pouring sodas from the machine and spilling on the floor. And they were ""delivering"" ketchup to the tables: 11 in all. 

Once we ordered we realized these were the manager's kids. How did we know? Because she kept yelling at them from behind the counter. Including when she yelled to the little boy ""did you pee in the trash can of the women's bathroom?"" to which he replied ""yes"".

Taste 11/10. Yes, over my expectations. Literally ""fall off the bone"", tender, flavorful and cooked to perfection. 

Service 7.5/10. Pleasant but nothing spectacular.  From the signage it is pretty clear that they prefer if you get your food and GTheckO. (In a charming and funny way) 

Price 5/10. I am sure the prep time, seasoning, and exclusivity goes into the pricing and availability. That being said $70 for 2 ribs is eye poping. Yes it will feed 3 people but that is filet mignon pricing for meat only. (And it is to-go)

Not sure what else is on the menu but the medium or ""B"" bbq sauce is as good as I have tasted. I do intend to find out how good the other food is.

We let the friendly woman at the counter know it was our first visit and she insisted we try the brisket.... SOLD!!! (She knew we would be) lol. We decided on a sampler plate with the brisket (best you'll ever taste) ribs, omg these have the most flavor ever!!!! And pulled pork! Each meat is so full of its own flavors I don't know which one was my favorite. The meats need no sauce. The Mac n cheese was so so creamy cheesy.

It's friggin' delicious, so much so that I kind of like that it's a little bit of a secret. And as their sign says, ""OPEN ...11am til until we run out"", sharing how good this food is just might make it even harder to run in on a weekend and grab some of the best bbq I've ever had (sorry Pops, it's really that good). 

There are those days in your life when you need something spicy, salty, gooey and crunchy all at the same time for example: the morning after your 21st birthday; that last week in your pregnancy when you are SO hungry to can still eat anything without feeling like Violet in Charlie and the Chocolate Factory; and after implementation of new organization wide software with more bugs than a seedy hotel. Today was one of those days and when I saw brisket nachos were on the menu down the street at this little gem, they were a must have. 

For $13 and some change, you get a heaping full take out container of tortilla chips, beans, the most tender and moist brisket ever, nacho cheese sauce, sour cream, black olives, pickled jalapenos, and a large swirl of your choice of sauce. My favorite is the blue collar (medium). Over flowing a pie sized take out container, it's enough to easily feed three. Yes it looks like a big, hot, mess but it tastes....it tastes incredible. The smoky sauce with a little bit of heat is the key. So good, seriously I can not say that enough! 

My husband actually discovered this hidden treasure when he saw it off the highway on his way home one night, after he decided he didn't want to cook. It happened to be beef rib day. He asked for three beef ribs, the price was over $40 with some sides and two pieces of butter cake. Taken a little aback, my husband soon realized why it seemed such a high price. Each rib must have had at least two pounds of meet on it. The rib meat was incredibly tender and moist, with perfect smoke rings. And the iron pot beans, perfect. Not mushy or overly salted, instead firm with a deep flavor that reminds me of camping beans cooked in a dutch oven. The hubs and the kids LOVED the butter cake, not my favorite, but still very good. Maybe because I tried literal crumbs, as the cake didn't make the 20 minute drive home. This dinner fed a family of four which includes two teenagers and we still had left overs. Since that time we've stopped by four or five more times. On two occasions they were already closed for the day. 

You see the dilemma: Share this outstanding small business in hopes of other bbq lovers finding a one of a kind? Or keep it to ourselves to avoid future early day closures due to sell outs? Apparently I've opted for the first option, but only because if you love bbq, you're going to add this to your list of favorites. And because the owners and their crew are such kind, funny, and genuine people. They want you to enjoy your visit as much as they enjoy making this incredible food. So go, grab lots of napkins, and enjoy.................just promise not to tell your friends! 

P.S. The word ""takeout"" is in the name because it really is meant for you to take out. There is a small counter that seats three on each side, but there hasn't been a time when I've been in there that every inch of counter space isn't taken up.",1,0,0,0

23193,44,5,2017-02-28,"So I finally stopped by Sparks & Smoke. I decided to go with a little bit of everything to get a good sense of what he does. Brisket, Pulled Pork, a half rack of Ribs, Pit Beans, Vinegar based Coleslaw (my favorite type), Corn Bread, and both types of Butter Cake. Gotta say the Brisket had a really great bark on it, was moist and tender, the Pulled Pork was tender and juicy, the Ribs were fall off the bone tender, the Cole Slaw was good but I wanted a touch more sweet to it (just me) but the acidity complemented the BBQ very well, I enjoyed the Pit Beans a lot because they aren't the traditional baked beans.

 Now on to the Corn Bread. After having to sample many many different types of Corn Bread for my wife I became a expert on it. Both my wife and I had the Corn Bread and it was good. Not too dense, good touch of sweetness and works well with his BBQ. 

Troy sent me home with a small bottle containing something called Hazard Pay BBQ sauce. It has a eye dropper to apply it. This sauce is fantastic. Honest to god it's great,  it's extremely spicy but has actual depth of flavor. It's not just got to be hot but has sweetness to it. I found myself adding some drops to every bite because I enjoyed it so much. I couldn't put it down. 

The Butter Cakes were a pleasant surprise. Very gooey and dense. My wife really liked the original version but the Chocolate one spoke to me. It was not as sweet as the original which I like and actually tasted good with a drop of Hazard Pay on it (don't judge me). Gotta say I'm glad I stopped in. Sparks & Smoke is a great addition to Reno's BBQ scene and if you haven't been it really is a must try. Now it's time to relax and try not to drink that Hazard Pay Sauce.",1,0,0,0

That being said this review has nothing to do with business and is only indented because of my experience with the food. I DO NOT make it a habit to review my clients, telling you this for full disclosure because I am not trying to BS... now on to the review...

So a couple things that need improvement. First off after eating the amazing food(no shit the best BBQ I've ever eaten in my life) I found myself really really wanting to take a nap... unfortunately because work was not over and it was around 1 in the afternoon a nap is not feasible. What I'm trying to say is that tho the food is downright amazing, the portions are remarkable and will not leave you eager for more food...

The owner is extremely open about his food and is amazing in helping his customers understand the story behind his food as well as the science that goes with smoking BBQ... and yes apparently it is a science.
This man can explain how this works on a cellular level to help you better understand why the food taste so dam good! This is a good indication that the man gives a dam and knows what he is talking about when it comes to his amazing hole in the wall shop.

The second issue that I had is that after I had lunch at his restaurant I found myself craving for more for dinner... I want to try a sample plate of everything he has because it's all so dam good... he let me sample his home made ""gooey cake"". And yes he gives a dam about desert too haha. 

If you stop in just ask to see what his ribs look like, and for a small taste of the brisket. The friendly staff will more than likely accommodate. And after you get your food you may just wanna take it home to eat it because of the food coma you are going to wanna be in...

Seems that most people are after brisket when I am there, it's very, very good but I am a rib man. Very few places in town have pork ribs that fall off the bone. If you prefer that, then come here! The rub and char is perfect, so most of the time I skip sauces. 

Cornbread is the best in town, the current Iron Pot Beans are sans sauce, so drop in some Doo Rag sauce to make those into BBQ beans. They are working on more side experiments with different coleslaw options, bean options and last week I beta tested a new mac n cheese. They took feedback and are constantly  looking for 100%.

Every day is a special, and the Food Coma Friday specials are my go to. Frito Pie, brisket and gravy and brisket street tacos are great things to try. Beef Rib Thursdays are also a good event to check out.

As the name states, it's get in, and take your food out. About nine stools for a quick lunch, so don't expect a six top for your party. Very limited seating.

For dessert, try the (O-face) Butter Cake. The reason they have a 5 gallon cuss jar there (for the Hug High School Marching Band) is from my outburst after trying that cake. Glorious.

Food was fresh and tasty. Iced tea really tasted like tea. Small fruit salad was arranged delightfully and satisfying. Potatoes are unsalted, so you can adjust to your preference. Spicy sandwich is indeed spicy, solid medium level and didn't need more (while still being able to taste food). The kale salad was delicious, soft and crisp at the same time, honey adds perfect touch of sweetness and tastes like very good coleslaw.

Service was lovely, hire ppl with disabilities nice 2 see.
Restaurant was clean. Employees hardworking.

Got some food to-go for a friend.
Used the app for both orders.
Not easy to find a place to eat if u sit alone.

Note: This restaurant is a Chick-One restaurant, where they are trying out a limited menu.

MISTAKES: on 1st order, they forgot the almonds in the ""crunch"" salad. Yet included condiments that I didn't ask for. On take-out they forgot the #bacon on to the club sandwich and that was really disappointing. These seem like very basic mistakes, not to mention food I was shorted, so I don't appreciate it. 

Bad 1st impression, but I still respect the company. Not sure what happened to their front door that day, either.

 In future I will be more picky & pushy about orders, but it's not my style. If that kind of mistake happens again, I'll prob take business elsewhere, because I don't recall other fast food chains making those kinds of mistakes.

Walking in it's a very modest little restaurant no frills.  You order from the counter and the people there are welcoming.  One of the first things they ask is is you have been there before.  If you haven't they give you a sample of their brisket, which is some of the most tender I have ever had.  It can be cut by a fork and just gets your mouth watering.  
Today I got their special which was a Mac and cheese pulled pork sandwich. I am glad I chose to split it. It was amazing but super filling and decadent. You get it and the sandwich is loaded with pulled pork and Mac and cheese. It is literally falling out of the sandwich. The flavor of the pork is fantastic and the homemade Mac is awesome super creamy and done right. The flavor just explodes. The bread on it is super crispy and provides a great juxtaposition to the soft textures of the inside of the sandwich. A half of it will fill you up easily.

Today I decided to try out Popeye's - Louisiana Kitchen new location just off Parsons Rd. 
I do love chicken and more so if it is Louisiana type . Cajun food and that deep south style cooking is just a sensation for the taste buds. 

But the one thing I do not like is eating out of a box. To me it just seems so childish ... maybe it's just me ! So I took my order to go.  Once I got home, I can plate it the way it should be and dig in. 

First off, the fries are really good and just the way I like them.. crispy brown on the outside and seasoned just right. The Cajun fries is perfect ! ( not like other places that sell Cajun fries.. hint to a couple of guys and fries). 

Secondly. The chicken. Wow.. not only are they a good size but they have a great taste as well ( KFC has to up their game !! ) . 

The only thing I did not like so much was their coleslaw- but then again I am really fussy when it comes to that.  Found it to be a bit runny .
All their combos come with a biscuit and a good choice of side dishes. 

This location just opened and there was a good number of people in the dining area and the drive thru. The amount of staff members on shift though was plenty.  The menu choices are pretty good too.  The only thing I could have used was a side order of gravy. 
As I said, I am not a fan of fast food restaurants. But if I was to go again to fulfill my craving, no doubt it will be Popeye's . Food arrived fast ( cant wait too long for FAST food ). 

Overall .. This place has better chicken than other places !",1,0,0,0

Because at this location, for some reason,  there is no water available at the self serve soda fountain.  I was told I would have to buy bottled water. I explained that my child was choking and we are paying customers (with other paid beverages) and we just needed some water. I again was told I would have to pay. My 4 year old refused to drink the soda that his older siblings had. And unfortunately, even if I dumped the soda out of the cups that I had paid for, I would not be able to fill it with water myself for my 4 year old.
The most upsetting part was the lack of concern on the part of the ""manager,"" who positioned herself between me and the employee I was talking to.

I love good BBQ and this place does it right! I've had their brisket and their pork ribs before, but, their Beef Ribs take the prize.

I'm a Beef Ribs snob...anyone can do brisket or pork ribs (& theirs are superb), but, Beef Ribs are an art unto itself.

I ordered 1 pound ($17) and was served the most appetizing Beef Ribs I've seen in a VERY long time. This was a veritable ""Brontosauras"" slab. It was cooked so perfectly that the bone never made it to my plate, as it had fallen off the meat while they were dishing it up! No need for sauce, as the flavor was perfect on its own. No need for a knife, as it was fall apart perfect, as well. Great texture and flavor to the meat, amazing ""crust"" to the slab, outstanding ""burnt ends""...everything about it was superb. I couldn't have asked for anything better.

Just a reminder, this is not a ""sit down"" restaurant...it's a classic take out joint with a few seats at their window counter. No need for ambiance, the food makes it the outstanding experience that it is!

Thanks to the owner (Troy Donson) and his family that work there for one of the best BBQ Beef Ribs experiences I've had in many a year. I'll be back on Thursdays for more Beef Ribs, as well as on any other day for the rest of their delicious menu.

The staff, though short handed were real real real great. Even though this is not a sit down and order place but more like a traditional rib joint where you order and pay then they bring you all the goodness.
One recommendation is to imitate rib joints that I have frequented in other states. Have a towel holder at each table with paper towels instead of napkins.
Now back to the food, I ordered a pound of brisket and a rack of pork ribs, medium beans and some coleslaw. That was plenty for five healthy eaters.
The brisket, need I say more, just order and enjoy, but do get the medium sauce. The ribs were almost fall off the bone and very tasty and hella good! The beans had some brisket in it and the slaw had a hint of horseradish in it.  It would have been even better if they had ""Dino bones"" but we'll have to leave that up for another visit.

23349,44,4,2019-02-15,"Best BBQ sauce ever!

Food: B+
My boyfriend and I visited here on a Saturday afternoon. We ordered a half rack of pork ribs, 1lb of beef ribs (which literally ended up being 1 rib - cows are huge!), and a pint of coleslaw. Both the pork ribs and beef rib were tender and juicy. I wasn't as big a fan of the pork ribs as I was the beef rib, but that is mainly because I like beef more than pork. Also, the pork rib fell off the bone too easily. I know that seems like a silly criticism but it made the ribs messier to eat. The coleslaw was disappointing, to say the least. I don't think there was any mayonnaise in it and it was not sweet at all. I love coleslaw so I was sad that Sparks and Smoke BBQ's was inedible for me. 
By far the best aspect of Sparks and Smoke BBQ is their BBQ sauce. They have 3 types: White Collar, Blue Collar, and Doo Rag. White Collar is the least spicy and Doo Rag is the most. My boyfriend and I tried these three sauces on their own just to see which we'd like with our order. They taste very average on their own, but with meat, they are phenomenal! The sauces are 100% enhanced when poured over meat. My boyfriend and both agree that this is the best bbq sauce in town. In fact, it is so good, I went back a week later and ordered a bottle of the White Collar and Blue Collar to have at home!

Atmosphere: A+
The staff is insanely kind. When we went up to the counter to order, the lady at the cash register asked if we have been there before. We replied no and in consequence, she gave us each a sample of brisket. This sample was huge. It took me about 3 bites to finish mine. Also, the brisket was amazing, and that means a lot from me because I don't even like brisket. In addition to the generous sample, Sparks and Smoke BBQ gave us little hard candies, 4 wet towelettes, and 2 Airheads. When was the last time you ate an Airhead!? This place has amazing customer service. I only wish they stayed open past 6pm!

I ordered a chicken breast sandwich. The one that's on sale right now. They asked me what cheese like normal l, heat the breast up In the microwave before toasting it, like they were supposed to. Then an older woman asked me what kind of sauce I wanted on it and I said mayonnaise and honey mustard. She reached for and put on light mayo. I stopped and asked, is that light mayo? She said ""we put light mayo on always unless they ask otherwise.""
Hmm.. funny that they didn't do that when I worked there. If they say mayo, you do mayo. If they want LIGHT MAYO... they'll ask for it. 
I told her I didn't like light mayo. She asked me if I wanted her to scrape it off with her knife...as she began trying to scrape off sauce, taking cheese with it.
I told her I'd like a new one because that one was now grossing my out. With attitude she says, ""ooooooook.""

USED to be the word!!  We were way South Longley Lane today and I am done cooking thru this Quarantine, I am so over it.  I was so excited to get BBQ and go home!!  Yay, me no cooky for me. Sweet!    We called in our food about 11:30 am. For an 11:45 pickup time.  I asked the girl on the phone if they were still on Clear Acre and McCarran blvd., she said yes, ok, 2 brisket meals, she said, coleslaw, beans, meat and Hawaiian rolls.  1 full rack of ribs.   

No BBq place where it used to be, she said the new address was 970 N McCarran blvd, head out 20 minutes, map stops... hubby is now pissed at me , thinking my Iphone is bS, as he is an Android user. Haha. His Google barely works, BS dude. Bite me.   I called again, she then  said 977 S McCarran blvd, so many miles from us, so annoyed.     She spouted off with 2 meals of brisket, with coleslaw and beans.  4 Hawaiian rolls, 1 rack of ribs, yum. Picked it up and told the girl, she took us on a wild goose chase, she said , oh my I need to go back to bed, i said, you took us to 970 N McCarran blvd, when you are way south. Geez. Ridiculous.  We only had a short amount of time and she wasted over an hour. I was pissed. But did not want to embarrass her in front of customers. 

Fast forward to tonight........ i am so sick of cooking, wanting to share with my DIL!!       We used to buy from here, and the food BBQ was way over the top, friendly service, etc........  go the fridge at 7 pm tonight, wanting to invite my kiddos, wow, oh wow. Hell no. Food was minimal. The girl said MEAl , mind you, she said, coleslaw, beans Hawaiian rolls, meat.  We asked many times, she said yes. We had no menu.   Open up meal at 7 pm, it was an awful day and I teared up, thinking we had many days of food.  Wth??  It used to be way way better , nicer staff, etc..l

$62 bucks and my hubby said, she had the nerve to ask for a tip, hubby frowned, but i gave $5. Who asks for a tip?  Soooooo rude !!  This half ass meal meal was worth $30,not 62 plus!!   So beyond pissed. This place is not what it used to be at all.   She said 'meal', coleslaw, beans, rolls she said.. she needs training for sure.  Bye bye. BJ's BBq it is next time.

23402,49,4,2016-02-15,"Nonstop nuggets, that sums up the whole review.

I wouldn't normally review a place like this - it's fast food, you know what you're going to get. But then a coworker noticed a flyer from here - $13.99 (I think, it might have been less) for bottomless chicken nuggets, fries, and drinks. Even if that wasn't a good deal (depending on how hard you were planning to nug) it'll be worth it for the entertainment value, right?

So we showed up on the appointed night, and the place looked like a mob scene inside. But there was a parking spot, so we went for it...and walked right up to the register. I figured it would be 30 minutes before we got any food and then it'd take 30 minutes before we got any refills, but we ended up ordering and paying for our meals so fast that they didn't even have time to hand us the mildly hilarious rules that we were agreeing to...something my friend later referred to as ""nugget entrapment.""

We turned our receipt in for wristbands (and the girl manning the wristband counter was super apologetic when I said I needed to photograph it for my expense report) and a cow cutout on a stick (which we were told to hold in the air when we needed a refill) and sat down to tuck in to our nugs. You start with a 12 pack, and subsequent refills are also 12 packs. We largely opted to focus on nugs and not fill up on the fries, to increase our ROI. And the gangs of roaming employees, with trays of fresh nugs, meant we never had to wait more than a few seconds for a refill. At one point our refill sign went up and someone *in the kitchen* saw it first and delivered fresh nugs in mere seconds. Similarly, barriers to access on sauces had been removed, thanks to bins of them, conveniently located for grabbing.

The theme I'm going for here is just that the whole thing was superbly executed. I give the Chick-fil-a corporation points for granting their franchisees the latitude to do something like this, and I give this restaurant points for pulling it off really nicely, and frankly, based on the employees attitudes, having a lot of fun while doing it. Yes, I know they are always unnaturally happy anyway, but the place was pretty busy and those smiles were still painted on.

I ended up only double nugging. Which may not have netted me much benefit over just buying that many nugs, but for sheer entertainment value, this can't be beat. A coworker managed to execute quad nug damage, but he's way more man than I am.

Anyway. I hope they do this again. I'll be back.",1,0,0,0

Re: Troy the ""business owner's"" comments. 

These comments truly show the mentality operating this business. Interesting how the other BBQ restaurants don't ""run out of food"" and close their doors. Imagine if all businesses simply didn't know how to stock their shelves or prep for dinner service and they all just closed whenever they ran out. Imagine a society that acted like that. But wait its gets better. The business owner then comes out with his inflammatory attitude and so called rebuttal, which thankfully shows his true colors. Folks, do you want someone like that serving you food? Would you trust someone like that with your health? See Troy, this is how Yelp works. The public has no obligation to be professional in their posts. Yelp is 100% about opinion, perspective and sharing your experience. But, you however do have the obligation to be professional and treat the public with respect.

""The Saxman's"" choice for lunch today - Thursday Daily Special - we had 2  1/2 pounds of the Beef Ribs at I think it was $17 per pound.  OMG I felt like 'The Flinstones""!! They were amazingly delicious - the biggest Beef Rib I've ever seen!! I wanted to go cave-woman style and just pick it up to gnaw on the bone! LOL but of course it wasn't 'ladylike' ;-)

When I first walked in, I was a little confused because it's a ""take out"" place... but they do have seating so you can sit and enjoy your meal. No fluff or frills needed here - the food and company was fabulous! The owner, Troy and his family that work there were super friendly and welcoming! He gave me a sample of their Brisket to taste... WOW just melt in your mouth joy! That's what I'm gonna have on my next visit - yep I will definitely be back - and will check out their other Daily Specials too! 
 
They serve the Beef Ribs until they run out, so either get there early or order ahead of time!  

Nice meeting you Troy and fam!",1,0,0,0

23424,71,4,2017-11-18,"MOD Pizza is a less than 10-year-old fast pizza chain started in Seattle that has spread to having locations in both the U.S. and U.K. 

I believe this spot in the new small retail strip across from Keystone at the Crossing (next to First Watch) is their first Indy location, though they do have stores in Evansville and Highland, Indiana. They are located in 27 states and they have a handful of U.K. locations. 

MOD Pizza makes artisan-style pizzas and salads that are individually sized and made on demand. They have pricing for a mini (6"" pizza or side salad at $4.87), mod (11"" pizza or entree salad for $7.87), or mega ($10.87 for a double 11"" crust pizza or family size salad). They have a concoction called a MOD pizza salad for $9.87 and a simple cheese pizza they call a ""maddy"" for $6.87. For a $2 upcharge, you can snag a gluten-free crust. 

MOD also offers orders of garlic strips or cinnamon strips for $2.97 plus they serve beer & wine ($4.97 for a glass, $11.27 for pitcher), MODshakes ($3.57 - chocolate/vanilla strawberry), floats ($2.57), and fountain drinks (Coke products, house-made iced teas/lemonades - $1.97). 

As you can probably guess, MOD keeps things pretty straightforward. They have 9 classic pizzas, but you can also concoct your own design and use one of 30 toppings at no extra charges. The salads are called simple, deluxe, and caesar. 

MOD, as noted, is in a new strip center with a couple identified accessible spots and an appropriate curb cut. As you enter the double-glass door way, you see the ordering line that is similar to that of other fast pizza joints like Blaze or Pie Five. The young woman at the front of the line was quite helpful after asking if I'd ever been there (I hadn't). 

You go through the line and pay at the end. I had a card for a free pizza,  a fact that seemed to throw off the cashier to such a degree that she never asked me if I wanted a drink or anything else. She had to ask a supervisor/management type how to handle the coupon, not unreasonable given they've only been open a day or two, but I was more bummed that I needed to then say ""I'd like a drink."" I actually was going to order garlic strips, but by the time it took two transactions I decided not to push my luck. So, ultimately, the confusion did cost them a sale. 

They give you a rather small plastic cup - it's sturdy, but I'll admit I find small cups a touch disappointing. It just feels cheap, though I did note seeing one young man going around offering to get people refills (though he never did ask me). He did, however, grab the door for me on the way in. So, that's a plus.

I ordered the ""mad dog,"" an 11"" with red sauce, mozzarella, pepperoni, mild sausage, and ground beef. They call your name out loud and you return to the counter to get your pizza (though multiple pizzas were delivered to tables). 

The pizza was a delight. Toppings were generous and the pizza had a nice texture with a modest crispiness that was just right. They sliced it into four decent-sized pieces and I had little difficulty finishing it off (though I hadn't had breakfast). 

In terms of atmosphere, MOD offers both tables and wooden booths including some high-top options. They have a small outdoor dining area off to the side of the building, a nice option in warmer months. It's also sheltered and would likely work even on a rainy day. 

While I can understand the 5-star ratings, I will admit I'm just not quite there yet. I was a little bit bothered by the check-out confusion and the lack of asking if I wanted anything else. I also found the constant calling out of names a touch distracting, especially whenever they got a rush of customers - and it was pretty steady while I was there. While the glass size bugged me, it would never be a deal breaker and I loved that they had two iced tea options. 

In the end, I'm docking a star and hoping I'll be able to give it back in the future. I definitely plan to go back, though I'll likely wait until it has settled down a bit. MOD has an emphasis as a chain on treating its employees well and customer service and, indeed, employees were super friendly. So, I think there's a good chance I'll fork over that fifth star in the future. 

For now, I'd still definitely give it a thumbs up.",1,0,0,0

Very friendly and he explained what made MOD different- alllll the toppings for no extra cost! For a veggie lover like me, I knew I had hit the jackpot.

I ordered the MOD crust ""build your own"" with BBQ base, dairy-free cheese (score!), artichokes, fresh basil, pineapple, olives, roasted red peppers, with a dash of dried oregano. The woman helping build my pizza was very accommodating to the dairy sensitivity I have and used tongs as she put the cheese on my pizza. Thank you MOD for understanding how much this means to someone with a sensitivity! The only surprise was that the red marinara dipping sauce for the garlic bread was cold, though it did not take away from our overall experience. 

Our order total for 2 people (pizzas, garlic bread, and two drinks) totaled just under $25. Great atmosphere, great food, great friendly staff. I only ate half of my $8 pizza and am so stoked to have leftovers for dinner. Bravo, MOD! This will be a regular place from now on.

We sat at the bar, the staff was friendly.  The only bourbon they had was Jim Beam or their well brand, the name of which I had never heard.  The drinks were fine, despite being made with diet Coke poured from a 2 liter bottle.The other liquor choices appeared very limited as well. We ordered the egg roll appetizer, they were over-fried, dry on the inside and greasy.    

Despite growing up in the 70s, we weren't fans of the Led Zepplin, Iron Maiden etc. rock that was playing (with commercials).
  
I ordered the ""cuban"", the brisket was moist but without much flavor and no smoke.  It was just OK.  My husband wanted the ribs, but at $32 a rack, he had the pulled pork sandwich instead, which was kinda just OK.  The fries were way over fried, mushy, and tasted burnt.  I think they may use the same oil to fry everything, and the oil smell followed us home, had to put my clothes right in the wash.

When I arrived home and opened the bowl it was much smaller than the typical bowl. (On a side note I eat chipotle 1-2 times a week and have for years)
Upon further inspection I determined the reason, there was hardly any brown rice in the bowl. If that was the only issue I would have been fine and not posted a review, however it was not. When I went to take a bite of my bowl, I bit into what I thought was Guacamole, but it happened to be a chunk of underripe avocado. This piece of avocado was about 1/4 of what was supposed to be my guac, which they charge $2.05 for additionally, which is approximately 1/3 the price of the bowl to begin with. Once again, I could have gotten over this hurdle if this was the only issue, but it was not. The icing on the cake was opening the chips and taking a chomp out of a stale unseasoned chip.

They had a DJ, who although was really great, I wish was not there as he talked and played music during commercials. Everybody knows the commercials are the best part of the super bowl and being an advertising major, I was really looking forward to the commercials that I didn't get to see. Plus we missed  the beginning of half time because the DJ left his booth and forgot to turn off the music so in the future, I HIGHLY recommend there be no DJ during the super bowl. Again, great DJ (i'ld book him for my wedding) but unnecessary for the event. 

Now... let's talk about the food. I order the 20 pc wings (my eyes are bigger than my stomach). I order 10- parmesan honey and 10 barbecue I believe.  I feel like my wings had potential to be great but because they were super crowded and had so many orders, my wings didn't get the love they needed. I would of loved for them to be saucier but the wings were crispy, hot and overall good. 

Our server was awesome especially with the place literally being sold out. There wasn't an empty chair in sight. Literally people were standing at one point because it was so crowded. So I think the place did great for the amount of people that were there.

So soft the menus aren't even printed and the bartendress  Rachel  was the walking menu lol.

So as in ghosts of restaurants  gone by its hard to tell if they're open with no outdoor lighting.  I saw some lights on and figured I'd give it a shot. Sat st the bar and ordered a stella..they also have local beers on tap..3 daughters...tbbc..etc.

The interior pretty much looks the same just refreshed and repainted. Looks good.

Ordered the 6 wings and fries lunch special for $8.69. The wings were house flavored with a dry rub and a side of got milk sauce. Wings were.hot and nice and crispy  and the got milk sauce rocks! Nice and spicy  hot!!

2 beers and wings were 24 with tax and 20% tip.

I love the double meaning in the name (MOD Pizza).    You can ""mod""ify the toppings on your pizza (choose one of theirs and add/subtract toppings or start from scratch and design your own).    And the decor/music is from the mod era (late 60s/early 70s).

The service is really helpful and personable.   They'll happily walk you through the ordering process if you're new to this kind of pizza parlor.

The pizzas themselves come out in under 5 minutes (due to the high temp oven) and have a nice crisp crust.   There are a ton of toppings and sauces to choose from so you're sure to find something you like.  There are even multiple variations of the same ingredient (mushrooms vs roasted mushrooms, sausage vs spicy sausage).

The workers seem to actually not understand that they are actually working. Having 6 customers lined up waiting to order while front line workers and cooks are standing around listening to a story about Lupe's kegger party that was broken up by the cops last night is not exactly how to run a business. When they resumed taking orders, I couldn't help to contain my laughter as the young lady assigned to burrito rolling clearly had no training. The guy in front of me ordered 4 burritos to go and the gal was literally bundling up the tortilla into a ball. A giant burrito tennis ball. The guy was basically like WTF? He looked at me and asked me if I had ever seen a burrito that looked like a snowball.  Well, my giant burrito tennis ball was tasty, even if I had to eat it like an apple.

23565,72,2,2017-04-16,"If you don't want to read this long arse review, skip to the last sentence. 
Let me preface this review with- I tend to relate cities/states to food. For much of my adulthood, I've wanted to go to the West coast mainly to try the food. In-N-Out Burger was top of my list of restaurants to sample. I was only in the area for a few days so I decided to poll my friends on Facebook to which all but a couple declared In-N-Out to be delicious. This place gets raving reviews from people of all walks of life so I thought, this was going to be a great culinary experience. I took a photo of the outside of the building as I approach this and was preparing myself to be amazed with the fresh, juicy and uniquely delicious taste that so many people claim this place embodies. 
So, I ordered the #2- a regular cheese burger-animal style (sauteed onions and some cheaply made sauce), fries and a drink. My co-worker ordered the same thing. 
Took around 15 minutes for the food to come out. 
I bit into the burger and was EXTREMELY underwhelmed. My first thought was what the h3ll was wrong with my friends for misguiding me lol. The meat was dry... not juice in the patty whatsoever. There wasn't much of any flavor in the patty. The sauces tasted like a cheap mixture of already made sauces.
I waited over 10 years to try this burger while, I really had been experiencing this burger every time I went to Burger King or McDonalds. Ok. ok. The veggies were a little fresher than McDonald's/Burger King... a better comparison would be the Southern chain, the Cookout. 

The food was adequate and cheap but if you are looking for a tasty and juicy burger- this isn't the place. I was advised to get my fries animal style but a good burger joint should have good fries without having to saturate it with sauce. Somehow, this place managed to find a way to zap all the flavor out of their fries. I ate about 10 fries and threw the rest away. 

I hate when I feel like I'm forcing myself to eat something and wasting my daily calorie intake... yet, this is exactly the feeling I had when eating In-N-Out.

After I came to the conclusion that I was forcing myself to eat this burger, I stopped and threw the rest away.

This is nothing more than an over rated fast-food chain such as Steak n Shake, Whataburger, Waffle House etc. 

I feel like people who like this place- must not have refined taste buds lol. The type of people that enjoy chicken nuggets at seafood restaurants... Just something isn't right with all these 5 star reviews... 

(oh and the person I went with- agreed to my review).

23587,78,1,2019-09-13,"I'm not the type to post bad reviews but enough is enough. This is not only the worst McDonald I've been to but the worst restaurant ever that I've had the displeasure of visiting. This perspective was formed over a total of 5-8 visits and it was a bad experience almost every time. Now some may wonder why I would keep visiting a restaurant after so many bad experiences; well I live way out here off mount rose highway and options are sparse so sometimes you have to make due but this was my absolute last visit. Now let's get to why I'm writing this review. To sum it up 80% of their employees have no customer service skills and are usually rude maybe due to upper management being the same way such as the person I dealt with today named Maria. They had got our order wrong and I caught it at the windows before paying and instead of just adding the missing item Maria decided to argue with me and proceeded to tell me to call corporate if I had a problem with a smirk on her face and i actually did take her up on that offer. I don't get it, would it have been that hard to push another button? This type of service is a reoccurring theme at this restaurant along with almost always closing earlier than the time posted and being out of items. I get it that it's fast food but wow at least have some self respect and respect for you customers to do you job even half assed because a half assed job would have been better than what I got today.

I didn't mind waiting since I was early. They brought my queso out and informed me that the gave me an extra one with chips since I had to wait. What excellent customer service! On to the food, the queso and chips were really good. I ordered a burrito with tofu, cheese, beans, rice, and red tomatillo chili sauce. Wow it was spicy. Maybe a little spicier than I like, but definitely had good flavor. It seemed like my cheese was mostly concentrated on one side of the burrito, but it was still good. The burrito was short and fat, which was different to me. The burrito itself was kind of chewy making it difficult to eat. But overall, it tasted good.

23595,76,4,2017-10-24,"So, let me preface this by saying that I am a big fan for Chipotle. It's one of the few fast food places that make my list. I was (and still am) very excited to have one right in Westchase. Most Chipotle locations seem to have the tiniest parking lots. Thankfully this is not the case for Westchase, which is nice, as it's always refreshing to not have to circle and wait for someone to finish their meal just to be able to park! In addition to the plentiful parking spots, I appreciate being able to eat overlooking a pond. I kept my eye on the water, partly out of necessity for fear of a gator sneaking up behind me, but mostly because it was nice to sit down and enjoy my food next to the scenery.

We arrived at a very unusual time ~3pm on a Sunday and I was pleased to walk right up and place my order. Never in the history of my Chipotle visits has this happened, regardless of day or time. I hope this isn't indicative of slow business overall, as I would be sad to lose this convenient location.

In terms of the actual meal, I had my usual vegetarian burrito bowl. It was tasty and the portion size was generous. The only thing that kept me from the full five stars was some less-than-fresh lettuce. I noticed that right away as I was following my bowl down the line and opted to not request any for my bowl. Much to my surprise, I ended up with some anyway. So, minus one star for slightly brown/wilted lettuce AND for not listening to my requested toppings. I easily removed the clump and enjoyed the rest of the contents of my bowl.",1,0,0,0

So so wrong. My boyfriend really wanted to try this place out so I said, ""Fine."" Literally everything here is perfect. 

When you walk in, you're greeted with an ensemble of Hi's and welcome's. Then if you're like me, you walk up cluelessly and stand close enough to read the menu, but far enough away from the staff that they aren't sure if you need help. One staff member kindly asked if it was my first time and then gave me a rundown of what MOD's all about. Thank you for that, because I seriously had no idea what I was doing. 

Turns out the concept is pretty similar to Blaze. They have a menu of pizzas or you can create your own as you go down the line of ingredients. I opted for the create-your-own 11"" and threw on some veggies and pizza sauce. All for about $8, which is pretty decent.

Then I thought, ""Okay, well if it's similar to Blaze then I bet it'll taste pretty much the same. Cool."" Nope, this is a crispier pizza and much more enjoyable.

With that said, this is the worst Chick-fil-a I've ever been to. 

1. I placed a large mobile order with a two-hour​ advanced notice. I come to the store to pick it up and the cashier and manager on duty told me that I never placed the order. So I showed them my phone and that I was charged for the order and they still told me that it wasn't showing up in their system. At that point, they said I could reorder since my card was not charged. Well, I didn't have time to wait for 30 minutes​ for a catering order they should've had. So the next day I checked my bank account and yep, I was charged for food I never received​​. So I called the store and the manager said he would get back to me. When I didn't hear back within a day, I called corporate​ and they said they would look into it. I didn't hear back for a week from both places so I called again. Another two weeks went by with no contact from the store or corporate. So I had to contact my bank and tell them the situation to get the charge off my card which I didn't appreciate because that involved​ me going out of my way to make time in my schedule to go to my local bank branch to talk to my branch manager. After all this, the operator finally decides to call me back and offers this crappy excuse of an apology stating that they have two locations and that their mobile ordering can sometimes get messed up. After I told her I had to handle the situation on my own because their communication skills were lacking, she offered no real remorse. It is safe to say that I didn't appreciate her apology and let her know it shouldn't take business 3 weeks to​ offer me a response or a solution to a situation​ that they caused. At one point, it became less about the money and more about the horrible customer service. It's almost as if they could care less about their customers. 

2. Service is extremely slow and the employees could use more training on how to better execute during those rush hours. 


3. Maybe find another operator because the one at this location is pretty much incompetent in my opinion. The reason this location is a disaster is that​ the owner doesn't know how to take control and fix the problems that customers complain about every day. I would suggest corporate or the regional sales manager come to​ observe this location for a week to see what I mean.

We are rushed through such short lines. Just a couple of folks could be waiting, and it's as if the line is out the door. They're friendly enough but never ask ""would you like anything else?"" before shoving the food aside to help the next person.

     The place is close to me, so it's more convenient, and that's why I go back. Plus, before I order, I say to myself, ""they have to get it right this time.""
     But anyways, whether I order in person, or delivery, or through mobile pickup, they always manage to get my order wrong! Most times, they don't give me half my order, sometimes they'll miscount something, sometimes they'll make something wrong, or sometimes they'll give me something totally different than what I ordered.
     I mean, all they have to do is READ their screen!! This place has the poorest of poor management! Don't even bother doing mobile delivery with this place, because you'll be upset with your order when you get it, and there will be nothing that you can do about it.
     Oh, lastly, when I do go back into the restaurant and tell them that they forgot half my order, they look at me like ""I"" did something wrong or something. They're looking at me like I got 2 heads. SMH
     So, when they go and make the rest of my order, they still make me wait over 10 minutes!! Unbelievable.

I never have confrontations with people, especially people working. I'm very nice when I approach a worker when there is something wrong with my order, no matter where I go.

This location is at the end of a short strip of shops.  It is the further business away from the driveway via which you enter the plaza.  You continue past the shops to the rear and make a left to get in the drive-thru lanes.  When we visited (just after 10:30 a.m. on a Monday) the line was already full.  At the time, I don't think you had the option of dine-in, so maybe that contributed to the drive thru volume.  There are 2 lanes.

We crept forward and eventually got to the order-station.  The voice on the other end was upbeat and helpful; that is pretty much a given at CFA.  We merged into the single pick-up line and continued creeping.  Once we got our food, we had to proceed forward and then make a U-turn and go back past the drive through.  You make a right and continue past the drive through. It is almost impossible to exit the way you entered due to drive-thru traffic.  Hence, you continue away from CFA through a bank lot to another exit and then get back onto Rosa Parks Blvd.

Loin, ball tip, round, flat, top butt, clod sometimes, and knuckle.  What is this??  A game of Limbo?  

The list should probably add statements like ""may contain peanuts,"" and ""this product was produced in a facility that also has wheat"" since those are also cheap ingredients and Chipotle seems to just buy from the lowest bidder.

This location is convenient when in or driving through the Westchase area (but traffic can be bad during afternoon dismissal at the school across the street). I have always found it to be clean and the staff to be friendly and efficient. 

The other day I was looking for something light to eat while running errands, but didn't want a bug meal or traditional fast food. 

Since I was out all day I didn't want leftovers either. I looked over Chipotle's menu for items that would fit my needs. I ordered a kid's size taco meal which ended up being perfect for my needs that day! The meal was served in an adorable box where each item was in it's own compartment! (i forgot to take pics, but take my word, it was adorable!) This way kids can customize their tacos personally - great idea!

Chipotle doesn't deliver solid every time like they used to. And grabbing to-go is a total crapshoot. Nowadays when something is wrong with your order there's usually an employee there to tell you how you're wrong. Which is a great bonus to a debacle in case you have one.

Honestly, I just stay away from Chipotle most of the time. It's nice to roll the dice from time to time, because if they make your order as advertised it's really really good.

Yes, MOD Pizza offers vegan cheese with lots of customizable veggies to create your very own fast and delicious vegan pizza! 

Located in the Keystone Fashion Mall area (across from the mall) and there is plenty of parking outside. 

I would describe this restaurant like a subway you stand in line, tell the staff what you want them to put on your pizza they prepare it, you pay, and the staff call your name when your pizza is ready to be picked up. 

The quality of the ingredients are good and the price is PHENOMENAL. One pizza is plenty to share between two people, unless you are extremely hungry I suppose. There are boxes to take your pizza to go as well. 

Oh, and again, the price is phenomenal because you don't have to pay per topping, choose what you want, as much or as little and it is one cost.

The layout of this place reminds me of a cafeteria. I think the uniform rows are why. I would find it awkward eating here because it is easy to end up staring at another person without meaning to. Luckily, we only stop by to grab food on the way home so this isn't an issue.

I have to share my newfound love for Chipotle since being on a restricted diet. I had to cut out dairy, soy, eggs, and nuts from my diet and almost everything at Chipotle (other than the obvious, like queso and sour cream) is allowed for me! Amazing!

I find the food at Chipotle pretty uniform and here is no different. It's pretty quick to get through the line.

The only reason this location doesn't get five stars is the cafeteria feel and parking can be difficult.

So we ordered and paid online for 3 subs for our company and sent one employee to go and pick it up. 
He came back without any food. You won't believe this. 
So he walked inside up to the register and said I'm here to pickup an order, the guy asked what name And he told him and he looked at him and said it's right here but I can't give it to you because you don't have a mask. 
He told him sorry he forgot it at the office. The guy grabbed the food and moved it out of reach and said I'm the manager and you need a mask. 
He said he'll be sure to bring one next time but the manager said you can't have this food without a mask so our friend asked for a refund if he can't have the food. So he finally got a refund. 
He was in that store for 10 mins without a mask just to get a refund instead of 1 second to grab his food that was waiting there and paid for. That manager clearly don't care about the business or the people's safety. 
If you don't believe this happened just like that then order online and pay online and walk in there without a mask to quickly grab your food.

I have only resorted to try and pick up because the curbside pick up is absolutely crap! Most of the other McDonald's when placing an order for curbside have the order out ASAP of course it depends on how busy, but I have never waited more than a few mins.

Im standing there watching the cook, this lady, putting together burgers carelessly and not really paying attention. I was right. When I got my Fish Filet, it was a mess. The burger it self was haphazardly slanted at an angle in the box as if the lady just threw the burger into the box with her eyes closed. The top bun was more than half way off of the burger, the fish patty was also practically sliding off the bottom bun. The cheese was folded in half; completely unacceptable. How hard is it to lay the square of cheese out flat on the bun? Lets not forget the tar tar sauce. There was almost not sauce whatsoever. There was definitely no extra tar tar sauce that I ordered.

Positives: clean new building, nice employees, no line. I tried some fried apps and they were good. Would definitely get the fried mushrooms and chips again, not sure about the fried cheese balls. Those were so-so.

""Negatives"": forgot the chip sauce and my salad dressing. Wah! There was some wait time but no big deal because I had no where to go..there wasn't a line or anything. Not a lot of vegetarian options unless you just get a side salad or salad without the chicken or the fried foods.

Their burgers are so delicious and the grilled onion is the cherry on top for me when it comes to their burgers. Their milkshakes are perfectly spun to perfection and pair perfectly with the burger and fries. #doubledouble

After a 5 hour bus ride I was ready for dinner for sure.  I was actually heading somewhere else and once again saw MOD and decided to stop in with family in tow. 

I was so glad that I stopped in.  As soon as we walked in the staff greeted us enthusiastically.  I said hello back in wide eyed surprise.  How many places can you go and get such a welcoming greeting?   Immediately I was asked if I had visited before and since I had not, they went to work explaining how ordering pizza works. 

I loved the fact that they have a tent style sign in front of the ingredients so you do not have to ask or guess what each topping is.  I also love the fact that a pizza can cost less than $10 and that they even have a mini size.  Additionally they have Coke products as well as Boylan soda and Pellegrino.   Nice!

This is a restaurant chain, and I recently saw that they were advertising for franchises.

I think the burgers are pretty good to excellent, and I like their milkshakes. I'd like to come into their store and give them 4 stars, because their upper management read my post and took action to become a service oriented restaurant chain.

Burritos at any location almost always rip based on what I've found. No fun. 

I order the steak tacos which come with 3. If I'm not super hungry I save the last one for later! But they're essentially prepared the same way as burritos. Think of them as 3 mini burritos!

MOD is a more recent import and ever since I saw the menu, I felt like a cheater. It looked WAY more appealing than Blaze to me.

I'm adventurous in pizza, but I judge on standards of simplicity: a good margherita, a simple cheese, and variations on the standards. In this, I found no faults. Added benefit? The pesto was simply sublime for fast casual pizza standards.

I sincerely hope MOD doesn't change as time progresses, and I was impressed with how they handled the current pandemic situation. On my bucket list still?

I see the employee put a chicken breast into the fryer but yet our food came out prepared just seconds later. I realized that they were premaking another chicken breast for who knows when. In any event the sandwich I received had an ice cold chicken breast on it that tasted like it was cooked hours ago. The bread was stale. To top it all off the minimum wage employees had a smug and arrogant look about them and tried to tell me that it was because the lettuce was cold - oblivious to the fact that I watched them cook another chicken breast fresh so that it could sit and wait for the next guest.

He went to lunch and then we went the next day also for lunch and even sat out with our dog. We also ended up their the next day as well with another coupon when my choice ended up being closed on Sundays. 
The trick for not getting hot is to get it without bread. I had no issues either day. We both got the big Turkey Club and they put mine on a bed of shredded lettuce. I really didn't want a big salad and all the toppings. I just wanted the meat and cheese and a little lettuce. I even got a dressing. It's the perfect light low carb summer lunch. 
The staff was working hard. Saturday was pretty busy and Sunday less so since it was later in the day, but before dinner. They even recognized me when I came back. The entire ordering process was easy and my husband as the app and he gets points for scanning his app. 
We really like the patio. Both days we were headed to the other side of town afterwards and it was great not to have to go back for the dog. He is small and sat quietly under our table and enjoyed my bacon.

I'll skip the food-quality part of the review and just sum it up quickly:  My meatball sandwich was great - no complaints there. My only suggestion is to do something to address the process of placing your order and getting your food.  There seems to be a very convoluted process of putting in your initial sandwich order, shuffling to your left, and then informing the sandwich maker which item is yours when it comes out of the toasting oven.  Maybe it's just me, but it seems a little annoying, having to point to which item is yours.  She should already know which sandwich is mine. 

My only other suggestion:  Don't ask patrons if they want mayo after you've already slapped it onto the bun.  Yeah.

Mistakes happen, not a big deal, my issue was with the woman who was going table to table cleaning up, checking on guests, asked if we were ok and I brought the error to her attention. I told her the order was wrong and she asked what had to be corrected and i told her ""just what's on the receipt is right, the order that was brought to us was all wrong,"" and she starts to take the tray off the table before placing it back down a few seconds later and telling me just to go up front and tell them. I'm sorry....so my options are i get up and try and stand off the side awkwardly by the registers as the workers assist the line (which at this point was pretty large) or you can take it behind the counter yourself and sort it out for me....wouldn't it have made more sense to assist the customer??

I ordered the cheesesteak with mustard, ketchup, pickles, hot peers, fried onions.  It had nearly no hot peppers and it was missing the pickles and the mustard.  The size of the sandwich was very small,  certainly not what I expected for the price.

I called to let the shop know that my sandwich was missing pickles and mustard, and the woman who answered the phone said ""well I can credit you 25 cents, but pickles are free.""  Really?   I just paid $20 for a mediocre cheesesteak and your got the order wrong.

I told Nick I'm not sure when I'll be back that way, but I'm gonna freeze the sandwich and bring it with me. Today I stop in with my sandwich only to be told they don't have any grilled chicken and I can't get my money back because the purchase was a few days ago.

Instead of mayonnaise on the bread they use hummus for this sandwich. I've never really thought about using hummus that way but it works. Gives the sandwich moisture but not a lot of fat.

They do a terrible job with food. Quite honestly, I've had better food at truck stops. MUCH better food at truck stops. And also, this was an extremely expensive lunch for what it was. I spent almost $9 here for lunch and that was WITH a coupon. The cheeseburger I got was absolutely disgusting. I've had cheeseburgers that were frozen that tasted better. It tasted like something that was a week old that had been peeled off the floor and then reheated. It's honestly the most terrible cheeseburger I've ever had in my life. The onion rings really were pretty good, but not as good as what they were charging. Those were the best part of the actual meal though. I also got a Blizzard, which of course was delicious, because this is what Dairy Queen is known for. So I liked the Blizzard. When I got to my car, and I do mean literally the second I sat back into my car after I got my food, I got an email notification on my phone for my birthday buy one get one free Blizzard. It actually really annoyed me because I had just bought my food and spent $9 for this ridiculous meal that included a Blizzard and then I get this coupon for a buy one get one free. Which of course I couldn't use because I had already paid. I probably won't return to Dairy Queen even though I have this coupon, because the food was so bad. Like it was really inedible. I just don't want to give them anymore of my money after this experience, and I wouldn't recommend this place to anyone...unless of course you're going there to ONLY get the ice cream.

I ordered an Italian Sub and added hot peppers, onions, pickles, and oil. They give you time slots to pick up, so give yourself an extra 15 min prior to place a order since pick up is in waves.

I've tried many a times and it always says it isn't available.  The majority of the staff always seems annoyed that you come in.  Yesterday I actually got a lecture by a young employee on ""how to make their life easier"".  

So if you want to get a good sandwich-you'll probably get one. You just may get it with a side of attitude (hence why I wish I could order via app).",1,0,0,0
24284,100,2,2019-01-02,"Have been to this location multiple times since I live 3 minutes away, never had a great meal here.  One time I showed up for dinner and they were ""out of meat"" citing the grill wasn't working.  Fair enough that happens sometimes but the food has never been great.  Often not fresh veggies, lettuce is often Not crisp, and the meat is almost always cold after a 3 minute car ride.  

Staff is typically friendly so I can't complain in that aspect.  But I recently went for dinner and ordered a chicken salad to go.  The salad was so wet and improperly drained that it not only bled through the bag it cause a tear in the bag, spilling chicken juice all over my house (pictures below)  I understand this may be a little extreme circumstance, but I suggest you just use the one on charlotte Ave instead.",0,1,0,0

24286,99,3,2016-12-08,"Okay, I don't want you to roll your eyes or anything. Seriously. Just don't. But, yeah. I've checked into this location of Chick-fil-A 98 times. 

Seriously, 98 times. 

So, needless to say, I do eat at this Glendale/Broad Ripple location of Chick-fil-A on a regular basis and I have a perfectly fine time nearly every single time. In fact, I'd have sworn that I actually did review the place not long after its opening. I was so convinced that I'd already reviewed the place, which I kind of think is an obligation after visiting it so often, that I looked up to see if maybe I'd had a review removed for some reason (not that I could see) and I just plain skipped writing it because I was so convinced I'd already done it. 

So, hey. I guess I haven't. So, now I am.

As has been duly noted, this location is an awful lot like most corporate locations of Chick-fil-A and is, in fact, a sister store to the East 82nd Street location. Just like all other Chick-fil-A locations, it's closed on Sunday, you'll nearly always get a ""My Pleasure"" after saying ""Thank you!,"" and the food you get should likely be considered a notch above the usual fast food fare. It's also, as usual, a faith-based chain, a fact that rankles some, and if you listen carefully you'll hear muzak variations of familiar contemporary Christian music on occasion. 

While I have always come to this location as it's closer to my home and I tend to frequent this corner anyway, I have to be the first to admit that the entire experience can be incredibly hit-and-miss. There are days I visit this location and am just ""wowed"" by the experience, culture and customer service. There are days I visit this location and am appalled by the dirty tables, lack of customer service attention and almost embarrassed look I get from employees when I say ""Thank you!' and they realize they're supposed to say ""My pleasure."" 

Located in a renovated Fazoli's and between a Crew Carwash and Jiffy Lube, Chick-fil-A meets standards for ADA with parking and has, as I recall, four designated parking spots with appropriate blue striping beside it (Cultural Lesson Note: This blue striping is NOT an available parking spot - it's considered part of accessible parking and allows for those with mobility impairments, like myself, room to access their wheelchairs. While Indy is notoriously lax about tickets for parking in these spots, it's actually considered a violation and you can get fined for parking there. Mostly it's just rude.). They do have appropriate curb cuts. I will admit I've had a couple times I arrived and all the accessible spots were full - this pretty much mandates either skipping the restaurant or parking toward the back of the restaurant that is far less accessible. 

The entrance is a double, glass door set-up. It's pretty easy to maneuver, though they tend to have employees nearby who will help if needed - this is more true during the lunch timeframe than evening. 

The ordering counter is to the right, the dining area to the left and a kids' play area is at the front of the store. Please note - the kids play area would not be considered disability friendly (though I'm not sure I've ever seen one in a restaurant that is). 

As has been noted in early reviews, they had kind of a rough start here. The service was wildly inconsistent and mistakes were frequent. Over time, they've filled out their crew nicely and generally they've gone from ""wildly inconsistent"" to a more tame ""hit-and-miss"" with most of the misses being mild-to-moderate and apologetically addressed. As a regular customer, I know, for example, if I'm charged the wrong price and will immediately question it. Because I'm regular, they listen and have always found their mistake. On one occasion, after 15-20 minutes I'd not received my food - they were quite apologetic and offered up a couple free sandwich coupons. Mistakes do happen, especially in 98 visits, but I've been pleased with their responses. 

There are certain key staff people who seem to inspire better operations and service. There are certain key staff who keep the restaurant clean, while others seem content to keep their bodies by the counter. I know when I arrive and look around, exactly what type of experience I will have and, for the most part, I've been right. 

I like this location. As a recognized regular, I am treated incredibly well. The Chick-fil-A culture demands a ""My pleasure"" after someone says ""Thank you"" and demands that employees go above and beyond with customer service. There are days when this location nails it perfectly, but I could practically name employees who are embarrassed to say ""My Pleasure"" and who allow the dining room to dirty up or simply never offer refills. It's the little things that make Chick-fil-A a special experience in the fast food industry, but when those little things are missing it becomes just another fast food joint.",1,0,0,0

I have been frequenting this location for over a month now, about twice/week. There have been several occasions of missing items, disinterested/rude employees, and no motivation to correct the errors made. Here are just two examples over the past couple weeks:

1. I use curbside delivery for my lunch just after peak hours (around 1 PM, only small line in drive-thru). After I am notified that my meal is ready, I wait 10 minutes before I start wondering what's going on. I call the restaurant from my car and politely ask what is the delay. I am rudely responded with ""We don't have any curbside orders"", only to hear another employee yell ""Yes, it's over there!"". 

A young kid eventually walks out to my car, does not apologize for the delay, and was seemingly clueless about what just happened. Needless to say, but because my meal was sitting somewhere inside for quite a while, it was not warm upon consumption. 

2. Only yesterday, I ordered again and received my meal fairly quickly, but no sauces or condiments I requested were included. Being a drive-thru order, I did not want to hold up any line and drove off. Only after I got to work did I notice many items missing. By itself, this is not a big deal. However...

... these are just a couple of instances that are uncharacteristic to Chick-Fil-A. By themselves, they are not a big deal (and I am more than patient). However, everything adds up eventually and this is no exception. Too many errors over a short period of time can only mean poor management with a group of employees that are not suited for the Chick-Fil-A standard. They require either retraining or get new employees. Maybe this will change now that school has started and all the spoiled NJ high school kids will be back in class.

Jersey Mike's has been our go-to for a quick and tasty lunch when we're short on time or just busy, e.g. doing yard work, decorating for Christmas.

We've probably been to this location about a dozen times, and they have gotten it wrong about half the time.  Once I got someone else's order and didn't realize it until I got home, of course.  It wasn't that bad of a drive back - 5 minutes - but the point is, we were hungry and we chose JM's for convenience.  

Many times they put too much oil and vinegar, which makes the sandwich soggy.  And about half the time, no matter how many times I write it (we always order online: see above reference to ""convenience""), they fail to follow the direction regarding toppings, veggies, etc..

Today, however, was just ridiculous.  I placed our order online at 12:18 with a pick-up time of 12:38.  No big deal - it is a Saturday at lunch time.  I showed up at 12:40, and that's when the fun started, folks!  Get your popcorn and adult beverage and sit back. 

When I walked in, I did see a line of about 4-5 customers.  I went to the pick-up station and asked if my order was ready.  They said, um, no, we haven't started it yet.  WT...you know the rest.  There were 3 staff members; one was working furiously like the elves in Rudolf; one was lackadaisical - type-cast out of Dazed and Confused.  The female cashier was OK.   I did notice that the busy guy had about a dozen sandwiches lined up (another pick-up order?).

Anyway, I grabbed a booth to wait patiently.  I did so for 10 minutes.  During which time I observed the line of 4-5 customers get their sandwiches, pay & leave, and then 2 more customers - walk-ins, mind you, order, pay, and leave.   So now, after waiting 15 minutes for an order (for 2 sandwiches, mind you, not Beef Bourguignon), my patience was running out.  I texted my wife and apologized for the delay and asked if she thought I should just pretend I was a walk-in?  She, being the brilliant one, said, hella yeah and also look a little psycho, that will make them want to get you out of there.  It worked!  I went all Bates Motel and sure enough, they said ""We're making your sandwiches right now, sir!"".

Yay. But not yay.  Because, during my HALF HOUR WAIT for a sandwich I had ordered an hour ago...a Sysco delivery truck had parked behind my car, blocking me (and 4 other cars) in for...another 15 minutes.

Upon approaching, I noticed that the ""Open"" sign was not illuminated, but I did see an employee behind the counter and a child present in the store as well.  I entered and after the woman began my order, I mentioned to her that the sign was not on and that I wasn't even sure that they were open.  At that point, a man standing at the register who might've been the owner or manager chimed in and made a somewhat smart aleck remark like ""Oh, I wonder how people ever know if McDonald's is open?!"".  I ignored him, but I should've responded by stating that on several occasions I visited this location during the normal business hours and no one is there!  Apparently, they have an issue with their opener arriving on time or calling off frequently.  

I said all this to say that again this morning, I arrive to a store with no illuminated ""Open"" sign, but I pulled into a parking space anyway.  I peered into the store and saw an employee, but as I began to exit the vehicle, I saw a note on the door.  The note stated something about opening up at 9am today.  I was annoyed.  This location needs to get their act together and the manager needs to work on his customer service skills.  He should've thanked me for letting him know his sign wasn't lit rather than trying to be a smart*ss! I'll go out of my way to visit another location from now on!",0,1,0,0

24329,95,5,2019-01-19,"This review is an accumulation of all the Chick-Fil-A restaurants I have visited. 
I am a stickler on customer service because we are paying for the merchandise and the service that is being provided...otherwise, we are better off getting stuff out of a vending machine...am I right??

They have created the best customer service interaction model in the fast food business, there is no contest!!  So, what can you expect when going to any CFA...the place is always clean, friendly staff, excellent customer service, the food is always spot on; fresh and delicious.  Their waffle fries are neck-to-neck with MickeyDee's fries is my opinion.  When dining in, the staff would routinely stop by your table to ask how was their service, if you need anything (i.e., refill, napkins, etc.), take your tray and clear your trash...what other fast food chain does that?

So, I visited CFA yesterday--like so many on Friday evening--as I pulling up to a parking spot I saw a CFA worker running (full sprint) thru the lot,  to catch up to a car after driving away from the drive-thru window.  I'm sure I won't see that at the other fast food spots!!   

This is evidence that fast food restaurant workers that don't get  $15/hour can still provide quality product and service to their customers. Based on my observation from visiting every CFA, management and/or owners must care for their staff well for them to continue to have that constant high-level performance of customer service.",1,0,0,0

I was starving about 1:30 pm on a Saturday and I saw the sign and eureka that's it!  Much to my amazement there were about 20 plus cars ahead of me that had the same idea.  There were two lanes running side by side, ten cars deep each lane, wrapping around the building, running under an aluminum pole tent with a white top.

The line was moving amazingly fast, and once you make it to the tent there were two order takers per line (wearing their masks correctly) armed with tablets and a hand held credit card scanner.  I placed my order with a very polite and competent young man, swiped my card, and proceeded to pull forward.  I passed a small tent where one employee was to take cash payments and make change.

You then pull up near the window where several runners are taking food orders to the cars in plastic storage bins.  They great you at the car with your name and hold the bin out so you can retrieve your order.  This entire process took around four minutes!!!!!  I have sat in line at another fast food restaurant only three cars deep for over 15 minutes before!

24340,107,1,2019-11-23,"This McDonald's needs help. 

I have been going to this McDonald's for years and am pretty much ready to move on.   

Unfortunately, the proximity to the Goodwill shelter is killing this place.  This McDonald's seems to double as a homeless shelter.  They cling to the place like ants to a dropped french fry.  Homeless are all over the outside of the McDonald's either milling about, smoking around the doors and sometimes pan handling.  Bicycles usually ring the building when the homeless are there to either eat, use the bathroom or do their business with each other outside. Too often the homeless will go into the trashcans outside, grab cups and walk into this McDonald's and refill them at the soda machine, without being stopped by the over taxed staff. 

Inside the place is filthy too often, the managers are always working too hard to fill in to get the orders made as it seems they can't keep a full staff here.  The lobby is also usually has plenty of homeless folks sitting in booths with their bags of possessions waiting for their phones to charge. 

All too often, any amount of traffic causes things to back up and patrons have to stand around the front counter waiting for their orders. 

I have been going to McDonald's for many years.  The quality of the food has steadily been dropping for a long time.  The added hassle of constantly having to wait for food when things are relatively calm and to have to deal with the assorted homeless people every day just makes it not worth the trouble anymore. 

It's embarrassing that a nearby gas station (Wawa) has far superior food and atmosphere than an established fast food restaurant.

So you order and give all the specifics about what you want. They make the sandwiches in front of you. Then you go to the cashier and they ask ""what did you order?""  I just went through this, now I have to repeat the entire order again?  Seems kind of silly. Here's an idea, whoever takes your order should write it down (I know, genius) and hand the ticket down with the order. 

Vanilla milkshake was good but nothing special. No whipped cream or cherry. 

Sandwiches were ok. Although both the wife and myself were missing avocado that was supposed to come with both. We brought this to the attention of the staff and they gave us some avocado and apologized.

The website gave me delivery windows in the Central time zone (both the store and my office are definitely in Eastern time). I converted to what I assumed was my desired time, but when the food failed to show up well after my 15 minute window, I knew this was yet another case of Potbelly screwing me over on my lunch break. I called to report the issue to a staffer who was more interested in rushing me off the phone than listening to what the problem was or doing anything about it.

You have to work hard to be as slow as the employees at this DQ. And rude. Both counter and drive through never take less than 15 minutes no matter how few people are in line. That's just for one or two Blizzards, nothing special.

This last visit we waited for 15 minutes, an employee finally wandered up with two cups of soup masquerading as Blizzards. Looked like they'd been a sitting there for a while. ""guys, this isn't wait I paid for, these are completely melted."" ""Well what do you want us to do about it?"" ""I'd like you to remake them."" And, begrudgingly, they did. Over 20 minutes for two basic desserts, with a crappy attitude thrown in for good measure.

Literally, the employees here do more work than necessary - remaking messed up or melted orders - because they're so lazy.",0,1,0,0

I've been looking for good Chinese food since I've been in jersey and I've found that jersey's Chinese is just different, to put it mildly. 
Typically, I can only order specifics from certain places. 
This restaurant usually has a line and doesn't offer delivery. So, on a whim I decided to try it. 

I ordered crag Rangoon (cheese wontons), which were fried so lightly that they weren't done and pretty soggy. The sweet and sour sauce that accompanied it has the most chalky taste. 
My general tso's chicken had cooked broccoli in it which I had to take out but it overpowered and changed the flavor of the chicken. The chicken was dry and the sauce lacked flavor. 
The pork fried rice was flavorless also. It's was absolutely gross. 
The egg roll, had an overpowering carrot taste. 
I don't believe in wasting food but I literally didn't eat it and threw it right out, the whole freaking ""inedible"" meal. 
I've come to the conclusion that this place is popular due to the cheap pricing... you get a lot of food for $10.

I wasn't very stunned at the amazing service because Chick-fil-A has always had amazing service! What I was stunned at was the fact that such great service could get even better. I got a chicken breakfast sandwich, hash brown and a decaf coffee for $5. Not only that but I was brewed a fresh pot of decaf because they did not have any on hand. Christian (the girl at the register) brewed me a fresh pot and said ""I will bring your order out to you when its ready."" I was like.... am I at a fast food restaurant or St. Elmos... UH... thank you!

I sat down to get some work done while using their FREE WIFI and really enjoyed the cleanliness of the restaurant. A few minutes later a girl named Nicole brought out my order. I said 'thank you' she responded 'My pleasure.' I have been to some expensive restaurants and have had worse service... This absolutely made my morning!

I also loved that they have a playroom and also have a small container of cheerios for small children. I mean does it get any better? Great businesses like these make you glow!

24420,99,4,2021-12-02,"I'd been contemplating doing an update review with this Chick-fil-A location for quite some time given the fact that I first reviewed this location shortly after its opening and times have changed quite a bit. I continue to be impressed with this spot's quality, customer service, and overall pandemic response. While not perfect, in terms of the fast food experience it's hard to find a restaurant that has nailed adjustments during the pandemic as much as Chick-fil-A. 

As is fairly widely known, this location is just north of 62nd and Keystone inside the former Fazoli's that has likely been long forgotten. It's snuggled in between a Crew Carwash and a Jiffy Lube. There seems to be a bit of a territorial thing going on here as occasionally Jiffy Lube and/or Firestone will block off driving through this parking lot. As has been noted, this is a relatively small Chick-fil-A spot and that can cause both parking issues and a line that occasionally will go all the way out into Keystone. Generally, they are good at keeping the line moving but on occasion I've noticed that their supervisors have to remind folks to move the line up. 

I've been a regular since Chick-fil-A opened. I think we all like that place where folks know us and as a single, disabled adult it's nice to get that sort of treatment here. Prior to the pandemic, I ate inside fairly regularly. However, a combination of my experiencing a health decline and the pandemic has resulted in my quite often hitting the drive-thru and eating in a parking lot or over by White River. 

Food quality continues to be consistently good. With the chicken wars having heated up, I can certainly name better sandwiches but when combined with customer service I'll still often choose here. Even at the drive-thru, I'm amazed how many employees know me by name. 

The prices are fair. The service is always strong. Even in their chaotic drive-thru, orders are typically right and easily fixed if not. I'm amazed how often they have employees working outside and the employees are always friendly and helpful. If anything, I think sometimes they move a bit too quickly. There can be a long line and they'll be taking orders at the back. Sometimes, this has meant warm food instead of hot by the time I get up closer to receive the food. 

I'm always amazed how quickly the drive-thru line actually works. Again, they occasionally do have the line go out to Keystone and on occasion I've skipped the drive-thru because of the lengthy line. 

The dining room is now open again after a prolonged period closed during the pandemic. They're taking the appropriate precautions, though I typically do more drive-thru these days. 

Chick-fil-A has also expanded into delivery and even offers delivery itself. It seems like this is a response to other delivery services and their exorbitant pricing. 

I'm a fan of the Chick-fil-A app, though it is occasionally slow to open. There's a solid rewards program and the managers pretty regularly just send out random rewards. I seem to have a delivery reward consistently these days that offers free delivery. 

Overall, I think this location has been pretty dazzling during the pandemic and they've worked to really keep business brisk. It's obviously working because while many chains have cut hours it seems like Chick-fil-A is consistent and largely keeping folks at work (though I have seen some turnover). 

Chick-fil-A also has a solid history of hiring folks with disabilities - this is obviously meaningful to me and a definite thumbs up.

COVID-19's indelible stain is there today in the form of masks, no self-service peanuts or condiments, half-capacity seating, and the awkwardness of finding an available ""twiddle nervous thumbs here"" floor decal as you hope to avoid the occasional irresponsibility of a mask-free customer. (To avoid dealing with such miscreants, the Guys also waive delivery fees during this difficult time.)

The food? If you want a no-frills burger for something to get in your belly, visit a dollar menu at any of the ""all-beef"" or ""impossible"" patty competitors. If you want a full-flavored, fully-cooked, piled with fresh ingredients meal that sticks to your ribs for hours...this is the place for ""regular"" (too much) and ""little"" (right-sized) burger excellence and the best fries on the block.

They were not preparing anything until I asked for those items on my bowls and did everything ridiculously slow. I had two bowls, the girl put chicken in both. One had a normal amount of chicken and one had probably half of the normal portion. I asked her to even it out and she said it would be extra. I said ""how? Look at the other bowl"". She turned to ask another rude employee and she looked back at me and said ""it's gonna be $2.63."" I have no problem playing extra for things I want (guac) but this was NOT extra chicken.

My friends and I went through the drive-though to order blizzards. When we were greeted on the intercom we told the staff member we needed a moment more. He said to let him know when we are ready to order. We sat there for almost 10 minutes and kept saying ""hello..?"" ""HELLO??"" into the intercom like loons with no answer. He finally came back on the intercom and took our orders. We waited several minutes more at the drive through window for the blizzards. A staff member finally came up and I gave her a $5 bill and told her that was just for one of the blizzards and my friend was paying for the other 2 blizzards on her credit card. We got our blizzards and I was waiting for my change but she never gave me any. Then when she handed me the receipt and the credit card I see that she had put the $5 towards the total bill and not separated our orders at all.

When I went to Potbelly's the first time, I discovered mushroom-forward sandwiches. First, it was the vegetarian sandwich: the standard. Always accompanied by an Oreo shake or smoothie (this was younger me, the version could afford the calories and the sugar). Then, I came across the mushroom melt: less bread that actually helped you TASTE the cheese better, as well as better overall veggie-to-bread ratios. A much more reasonable calorie count as well.

Potbelly's also carries some great, kettled-cooked potato chips that come in a variety of flavors like jalapeno. If you want a change from your usual sandwich joint, give Potbelly's a try. You won't regret it.",1,0,0,0
24458,97,2,2021-01-09,"Beware this Potbelly location. It is woefully inconsistent in quality.

I've avoided writing a review here because my love for Potbelly is long standing. I think my family discovered them in West Lafayette about 16 or 17 years ago, and I was hooked immediately. I've since eaten at many locations in multiple states, and I don't remember a single bad experience until frequenting this store.

I order the tuna salad sandwich 95% of the time I eat at Potbelly. I just love the way their hot peppers complement the tuna salad. On multiple occasions, the tuna salad has been SO dry here. For some reason, it doesn't seem their employees can follow the tuna salad recipe. One time, I had to ask for mayo packets to put on my sandwich because it seemed like they just gave me flaked tuna straight out of a can. So bad. 

Now since 2020, I've started ordering on their app and picking up carry out in the store a lot. It is a very handy way to be able to grab a meal ... if you could trust that they make your sandwich well. Unfortunately that only happens at this location about half of the time.  They don't seem to be able to follow notes requests well. I like extra hot peppers. I only get this on my sandwich every couple times. This I deal with, but what I can't deal with is getting home with a sandwich that has about half the normal amount of meat on it and completely torched, dry bread. If they're cutting corners and not putting the adequate amount of meat and cheese on, their toaster completely burns and dries the bread. Inedible. 

Things like this happen at this store too often. I've contacted Potbelly HQ about it when the store wasn't very old (after the no mayo tuna salad incident) ... that they need better training for a consistent experience, but this store just doesn't seem to be able to get a handle on it. I wish this weren't the store that was local to my work commute. I want to stop eating here. But I love Potbelly. It's frustrating.",1,0,0,0

I recall when this location opened.  I was actually surprised that what once to be Fazoli's (torn down and built as a new building) was to become a Chick-fil-a.  Cool I no longer had to drive to Castleton Square mall or to the Fashion Mall to get my crack chicken fix. 

This location seems to always be super duper busy.  If you are in a hurry, mobile order and park on the lot next door because if you do anything other than that you will wait.  I wish their parking lot was not so tight.  I have seen a few almost rear end each other car accidents.  Not sure why they just did not open the back to exiting out the side street behind Chick-fil-A as I am sure that will help with the parking lot war games I typically see and experience.

Such a great learning option and experience! 
The gentleman was very kind and helpful and had a nice step stool for the kids! 

Food is pretty well known... it nearly never varies, and is always very tasty! But great to get the kids meal free with order of adult meal.

Either way, we appreciate and are grateful for the deal to get the kids meal for free! Wonderful to offer this! It was definitely an added benefit that helped bring us in.

Quick and kind service, bringing our food to our table for us. Trash taken for us.  This time we didn't have anyone ask to refill our drinks, but usually get asked a couple times. Wonderful kindness.

Clean, tidy. All supplies (utensil, napkins, condiments, and such) are always full and tidy!

Prices are fair but shouldn't go up anymore or they won't be. One complaint they don't stay open later.

24492,118,1,2016-06-02,Don't eat here. I honestly went last night since and had a cockroach in my tater tots. I would have taken a picture but was so mad and beyond disgusted. My husband ate one and it was right on the top. I pulled them out in front of the guy delivering them to car since they have a history of serving hard and cold tater tots. I asked for a manager and when She finally came out I showed her and she accused me of putting the roach in the food so I can get free food. I told them I dont even want this food..I want my money back. She refused. She said she would put fresh oil in the fryer and bring me fresh tots.  I finally agreed and waited 20 mins and they finally bring the tots out and they were cold and only gave me one tot I had paid for 2. Very unprofessional at this location. While I was waiting 2 employees threw trash and flicked off a fellow co-worker in the main area in front of a family with kids. I will never eat here again.. and telling everyone I know what happened here. I would give this place zero stars if I could.,0,1,0,0

24494,114,5,2018-07-28,"There are two locations for the Super Burrito in the Reno area.  Don't bother with the other one, this one is the good one. 

We came across this Super Burrito by chance when we were just cruising around the Reno area. We stopped here for a quick bite and was just blown away by their shredded beef crispy taco. The beef was melt-in-your-mouth and flavorful. The crispy corn tortilla was fresh, not that premade Taco Bell shell. Together with the fresh lettuce and shredded cheese (I added fresh salsa), this is the perfect crispy taco. It doesn't have to be super fancy for me to like it, it just has to be done well and seasoned properly. Don't ask me how other places screw it up, but this taco is everything a crispy taco should be. 

I also have a thing where I always order Mexican rice at every Mexican restaurant I go to. I'm obsessed with Mexican rice! I'm happy to report that the Mexican rice here is delicious! It's has flavor without being salty.

Initially, we stopped at Burger King. I saw the sign from the parking lot for Greek food. I thought heck yeah! Soooo, while the hubby went into BK, I went to Little Greek to order takeout. 

Stupid. Stupid. Stupid - decision. 

I ordered the Village Salad for myself and the Gyro Pita meal for the hubby. I was going to order more for the 'kids' and I'm happy I didn't! 

The Gyro Pita - It had sooooo much shredded lettuce that we had to take so much off. It's one of those things when you say, would you like a little Gyro with your lettuce. After removing the copious amount of lettuce, it still fell short. Very short. Like shorter than me short! The fries that came with the meal, ummm there's no eating more than just one. They refried old stale fries. 

The Village Salad - Pictures are so very deceiving. Very. When you see a picture of a pretty little salad that you know is very easy to replicate and it comes out resembling a 'salsa' it's an epic failure. Diced... Every ounce of veggie was diced. No meatiness, no variety, no separating anything because you just can't separate salsa. The scoop of potato salad resembled mashed potatoes more than salad. The consistency was more like baby/toddler food or elderly, no teeth/chewing required food. 

The two stars - the nice guy who acted in a managerial position. If I could balance the review, the food would be 0 stars and the fast food service would be 5 stars...2.5 stars average. 

Sadly, great service will never balance really awful food.

Both experiences took way longer than I would expect or consider reasonable. 
Tonight however was so bad, I ended up leaving so that I would not be late for work.  No food, but I did pay them over thirty dollars for the meal.
I walked in the door to the establishment at around 6:12pm, was finally able to order by 6:18 pm.  
At 6:45 pm, I asked how much longer it might be as I had to get to work.  I noted that both last week and this week there were large orders that entered the store after me, however all other orders were left to wait while the staff dropped everything to make the large order.
I was quickly advised they ordered prior me online.  
Even with a prior order online, especially if the online order was at 6:10pm as one was pointed out, it should  have been stared and half finished by the time I was able to order.  Not held to wait for arrival of the ordering party.  Then you place everyone else to the end of the line and expect them to wait.
This is not good service.  This is not good use of resources.  The three employees litterally did stop everything else and only work on the large order.
This took 3 employees over 30 minutes to compete.  

When I enquired how much longer, the large order was complete and gone.  I was advised it wouldn't be long.  Although I was still next in line, it was clear my food had not been started.  Nor was it a priority to begin making my order after I asked.

I ended up leaving, noting the staff did not bother to begin to make my order.  It sat on their station from 6:18 to 6:48 with nothing started.  This is an unreasonable wait.  Noting my prior wait time of 25 minutes I left home even earlier.  However, being late for work with an excuse, that it was just taking so long to get my food order is not acceptable.  

So in the end, I left.  No food, paid over thirty dollars.  No resolution, no attempt at resolution.  No attempt to begin making my order after asking.

I love Raising Canes and their food is usually great however this time it was not. I ordered the 4 piece combo with a lemonade, no ice. There were 2 cars in front of me which took 8 min. For me that's a very long time if you only have a few things on the menu. When I got to the window I requested an extra sauce instead of the coleslaw. I understand how this could take some extra time but this caused a decent amount of confusion. Moving on. I get the food and start driving home. I decide to have a fry and it's not hot but not cold either. I drive 10 more minutes and get home. I eat the food and the chicken is warm, not hot as I'm used to. The bread is soggy and the fries are so salty most are going uneaten. The lemonade had a weird taste like soap? Maybe they cleaned it and didn't flush it well? I don't know their practices. Next time I'll go to the Manchester and 270 location, they are awesome.

24606,113,1,2016-05-29,"I came through to order something to eat before I headed into work. As I approached the speaker to order an employee asked what they could get me. I ordered a beefy crunch box with a drink. She asked if everything on the menu was correct. Within just a second, maybe two even, she talked over me as I was telling her it looked good asking me the exact same thing without giving me any time to answer. So I had to tell her again that it was correct because she talked over me in a rush. Which I found very odd as I was the only car in drive through. So I continued to the window to pay only to find her speaking to me through the closed window before she opened it to finish her sentence. She seemed very rushed by either getting me my order and out of there or had a lot going on some where else is what I gathered. But her attention was not on me. It seemed that she was quite rude hurrying me through without giving me the consideration of talking to me rather than at me. I was given no receipt so I cannot tell you her name or any other information. She asked me what sauce I wanted and did not give me any sauce at all when I told her I wanted fire sauce. 
I tried this location because it is down the street from my new job I began recently. I will not be back with service like this. I have worked customer service for years and there was none on this visit. I could have got better service with much more efficiency from a robot. I will stick to the Bellevue location near my home. The employees at that location are always pleasant to deal with when I visit that one. Well actually every one i have been to have been much better experiences than this.
The food was okay, nothing to brag about. Although that could have been from sitting in my car for a few minutes longer than i wanted before I ate them as the Taco Bell website refuses to accept a valid time in their contact email form (4:55PM by the way, 05/28/2016 what is invalid about that is beyond me) as I was trying to write this directly to them.

The salsa verde is seriously legit! It has a bit of a kick to it, but I could seriously drink it straight from the cups if given the opportunity. They don't charge you if you ask for extra sides of the salsa either. 

The chicken super burrito is a classic, but I just discovered the... Get ready for it... Chile Relleno burrito. It's a cheesy packed chile pepper stuffed inside a tortilla with cheese topped with ranchero sauce. I may need to get a gym membership after discovering this burrito because I have had an unhealthy obsession with it since my discovery. The best part of super burrito, is the tortillas are super thick, so they don't get soggy and fall apart if you have to travel a bit.

After she hung up she said oh, I'll have to take your order again. We finally got to place our full order and she told us to have a seat and she would bring our food. Typically it takes us about 10 min for our food to come out and it had already been longer than 10 min since the food went on the grill and she said it would be a few minutes longer to get the salads ready. 25 min later we were still waiting on our food and she said that they were still cooking our meat, which she put on before we even rang our order. She was extremely rude and unapologetic, and another 7 or 8 minutes later our food finally came out and she tried to blame the cook for screwing it up. The cook came out to our table and apologized profusely for the error, and said he isn't sure why she was saying it was his fault, and that she gave our food away to another customer.

What I enjoy about these tacos ($2) is they have a great crunch shell, they fill it up, not just fill up, but stuff to the max! There's plenty of that real delicious cheese. You then pour a good dose of the hot sauce (P.S. it's not hot) and it adds that missing peppery tomato flavor much like a french fry craves ketchup. The taco becomes a marriage in your mouth of all the ingredients, blending and complementing each other perfectly with each savory bite. My preferred meats are asada and then chicken or just get both!  

Then after you have had an excellent experience with the taco's it's time to fill up with the delicious and made daily beans. These are some of the best beans in town, and I don't think I have had a bad batch when it comes to the burrito ($3.05). It doesn't matter morning or night, they always taste like they were just made (P.S. I think they used canned beans on the super nacho's - they taste as nasty as they sound too)!

The cheese again here is excellent and it's applied liberally, so you get a perfect mouth feel and mouthful or warm delicious fresh hot beans paired with the tangy cool abundant soft cheddar all wrapped in a warm blanketing tortilla. Each bite is a superb combination of the three elements!

I googled ""little Greek Ulmerton"" and clicked ""order online"" via google. This took me to door dash for order processing. No biggie, I'm comfortable with this as I've order DD delivery from this location with no issues. I place my order clicking boxes for the items I WANT, not exclusions. The web said 15-25 minutes so I head there. My order was ready in 6 minutes - way off from the estimate provided. I arrive and request my order by name. A woman, seemingly the manager, seemed confused at how I was picking up for myself and not as a delivery driver for DD. She mentioned I should not be able to order via DD, only through her restaurant's website. She even thanked me for telling her. I told her then ""I'm happy to order through your site. I come here often and has no idea they took a cut!"" We left on pleasant terms. 
I arrived back at my office and opened my lunch to find my order was totally wrong. I absolutely hate beets and potato salad and when I ordered did NOT Check those items. I also had no dressing for me salad and no fork to eat with. I called the store to explain and ask if they could remake my lunch and I'll come pick it up - which seemed fair since I was worried about time to begin with. The woman on the phone was polite and clearly taking direction from someone else (seemingly the manager again) and said ""we'll be happy to remake it for you....if you go online and order it again and pay for it."" Confused I asked for clarification. She said because it's not liSted that way on her pick ticket, she cannot remake it. The pick ticket literally said ""tomatoes, grilled chicken"". I asked why everything else was on it and not just tomatoes and chicken then and she fell silent. I said have a nice day and hung up.

So ladt week we ate in and when getting our order I received my order with beans so I took it back and mentioned to the gal who took my order and she tells me I didn't order rice only. So WTF I'm going up there and lie come on I've always ordered that for years. So after mentioning I wanted rice only she told one of the prep gals to get me extra rice. The gal scooped up a normal helping into a styrofoam bowl but this is where it gets FU. She tells the prep gal to take half of the rice out so she spoons half out. I guess since I had 25 cents worth of beans on my plate I didn't deserve 25 cents worth of rice but should only get 15 cents worth of rice. Nut wsit she got the order wrong. So I guess instead of giving me my correct order which was $8.00 she wanted to not give me an extra 15 cents worth of rice.  So today we went thru the drive thru instead, just not comfortable about dining in, Covid 19. I ordered Chili Rellano plate rice only no beans and no salad fir my wife and a 2 taco plate with rice only no salad.  So I get up to the window and I pay for my order and mention rice only. She looks at me and realized it had beans so she corrected it and got my order handed to me. We psy and drive off. So uncover the container and it's rice only but whete they screwed up on was both were a taco combo plate. No Chili Rellano, my wife is vegetarian she doesn't eat meat so after all these years I think we a well done I should not argue with the gal taking the order what I wanted she should just give me what I ordered we are talking about pennys on their part where on my part I'm throwing 1/2 my lunch away.

Today I ordered a lamb gyro in pita bread with Greek potatoes on the side. I also ordered a felafel pita sandwich, again, with Greek potatoes on the side using my favorite food delivery service, DoorDash. DoorDash, as usual, was flawless. Unfortunately, the problem was with the food they delivered. 

What a huge disappointment both sandwiches were. Blech. 

The lamb was tough, tasteless and blah. Wet cotton has more flavor. Even the addition of tzatziki sauce didn't help because...the tzatziki sauce  was ALSO bland. The pita bread, on the other hand, was light, fluffy and tasty and the lettuce/tomatoes/onions were crisp and flavorful. 

The felafels were slightly better, but, were drier than dust. Again, the tzatziki sauce could have helped but was tasteless. And, again, the pita bread was perfect as were the lettuce/tomatoes/onions on the sandwich.

The Greek potatoes were slightly better, but, a bit too salty.

This was a case of not yelling ""Opa!"" after trying to eat the food. I'll give them another try with other dishes, but, I'm not hoping for better. And, that's too bad because Greek food is traditionally as tasty as it gets.",1,0,0,0

We get the ground beef super nachos and I have recently started getting ground beef tacos and they are so yummy! It appears to be a homemade shell, it is huge and stuffed full of meat not like those wimpy things taco bell calls a taco.

Try them, its not very visually appealing outside or inside but its one of those great local places. This location always has a long drive thru line and seems way busier than the other location. Drinks are coke products so I will usually take in a bottle of water with me. I dont do coke anything.

I'm not even usually picky where I go for Mexican food, because its always been at least decent. Every single time I've gone in my life...Until now.

Their enchiladas? Yuck. yuck. yuck. I hadn't eaten anything all day at the point that I tried mine and even then the fact of eating these made my stomach sick from one whiff and then especially a look at them. The taste, ugh, the taste was no better And I swear their ""mole"" was spaghetti sauce from a Chef Boyardee canned dish. Maybe from their spaghetti and meatballs canned cuisine.

Super Burrito is a Northern Nevada staple, and their food is pretty damn good! There's not much in the way of ambiance, but that doesn't matter.

So I went and ordered my go to, just to see if the rumors were true. An Al Pastor Super Burrito, wet. Sadly, I wasn't not happy with my burrito at all. Yes, it was filling. Yes, it was affordable. Alas, it did indeed lack taste, my burrito was mostly rice and the texture of the meat was dry, It had hardly any refried beans or guacamole either. It came with a quarter sized side of sour cream and the chili verde salsa was just water with some spices. About the only memorable thing was the Ranchera Sauce. 

Given this is a fast food establishment and so I'm not by any means trying to compare it to Chihuahua's Cantina or anything. (If you haven't tried their food, you should!)

The outside of the place is really run down and the parking lot is not very well lit, giving it a dirty look. The drive through is super short (as in, if there is more than one car, it is blocking the entrance to the place).

On the inside, it isn't much better. low lighting, run down furniture and paint all around. 
The bathroom (for the women that is), is tagged up. I had just went in after it was cleaned so the floor was still a bit wet, though still had that really grungy look to it, where you don't really want to put your bag on the floor or any of the surfaces for that matter.

First off, the menu is hard to understand for a first timer. With one sections for 'plates' and another for 'combos'. aren't they the same thing??

Well the food.... definitely needs a lot of work. Overall nothing had much flavor and what did, was minimal and not very tasty.

I ordered the taco combo. My daughter ordered the nachos (just the regular ones), and my husband got a combo with chile relleno and al pastor taco. both combos came with rice and beans.

Nachos: for just regular nachos... it was liquid cheese, shredded cheese and some random bits of lettuce and olives that I am sure were not supposed to be there. The liquid cheese had no real flavor to it, not even cheese flavor, and was only luke warm, which in turn never melted the shredded cheese on top. The chips seemed a bit stale.

ground beef tacos: The shell had no flavor and pushing its expiration date as far as freshness goes. the ground beef inside again, not seasoned, and seemed to have been out for a while, where it was kind of dry and crunch (for meat, this is a bad thing).

al pastor taco: why would anyone put cheese on an al pastor taco??? aside from that, the taco was cold. the meat again with no flavor.

rices: this was the only thing that had any level of tasty to it. and it still needed salt. it seems like this is one of the few items that they make from scratch.

beans: taste like they came out of the can (maybe rosarita?). on the plate they were room temperature.

24898,114,4,2017-01-09,"Super Burrito is basically fast food Mexican and I feel that to rate it properly you need to rate it from that genre - as fast food. When comparing Super Burrito against Del Taco or Taco Bell or McDonald's... it simple is just better. 

I seldom go inside, so I really can't give a review on a sit in experience, just the drive through experience.  The service is friendly and fast. 

The food is made to order, the portions are huge, and the cost is super cheap.  I normally get the super vegetarian burrito. For about $5.00 you get a massive burrito filled with , rice, salsa, avocado, and cheese. You sprinkle hot salsa over it and it is a delicious fast food meal! ...and let me re-empathize the portions are huge! It is the size of 4-5 Taco Bell Bean & Cheese burritos! 

I have also had their take-out cheese enchiladas and super nachos.  The cheese enchilada meal comes with rice and beans, while it is not anything spectacular, but when considering for the convenience and cost, it is worth ordering again and was tasty. The super nachos come with a huge portion of corn chips, cheese sauce drizzle, and covered with shredded cheddar cheese.

24909,119,3,2021-12-29,"Despite being a lifelong Indy resident, this is only my second time in a Penn Station location. This spot is located in Broad Ripple in the same strip center that houses Biscuits, Shalimar, and my good ole' buddies at Magic Bus. 

Penn Station as a chain first opened in 1985 in Cincinnati. It has grown into a 15-state chain with 306 locations. 

The Penn Station menu features an array grilled Penn Station submarine sandwiches, fresh-cut fries and hand-squeezed lemonade. All the sandwiches are prepared fresh in full view of the customer using hearth-baked bread, USDA Choice Steak and potatoes that are hand selected, fresh-cut and flash-fried in cholesterol-free peanut oil. The lemonade is made from scratch every day using hand-squeezed lemons.

I'm not sure how old this location is in Broad Ripple, though it's been here just about as long as I can remember. This strip center has fairly decent access with sporadic accessible parking spots, older but functional curb cuts, and everything is on a single level. The single-sided glass door is a little heavy but not bad. As you enter, the ordering counter is to the right and a dining area to the left. The dining area is rather narrow - it reminds me a bit like a subway. I was able to wheel down both sides of it, though if Penn Station is crowded it does require a bit of caution. 

There is a large menu at the door that I completely missed. They don't have overhead menus and the only other menu is on their counters and their counters are definitely higher than wheelchair height. 

They primarily have a variety of sub sandwiches that come in small, regular, and large. They do have some other sandwich and salad options. 

I'm not aware of combo options and one was not offered. 

I ordered a small turkey and provolone with mayo (it apparently also came with tomatoes). I also ordered a small order of their fries - my first time trying them - and a large unsweetened iced tea. They carry Luzianne iced tea in the fountain (which is self-serve). 

The food was delivered in a carry-out bag, though I was staying. I found an end table that had a chair I could easily remove. 

The highlight here was definitely the service. Employees were friendly and helpful throughout my stay. 

The food is rather middling to me, especially at a price that I could have easily matched for what I'd consider fast casual. I paid a bit over $12 for a fairly basic meal. The fries were fine, though given it was a small order they seemed more like nubs than actual fries. The sandwich is a cold sandwich (which I was told) and it was perfectly fine. Basically, this was pretty much the definition of an average meal. 

The atmosphere is, perhaps, the least pleasing thing here. This ""looks"" like an older location. The paint is somewhat faded. There are stock Penn Station photos on the wall and a color scheme that is so neutral you could practically meditate with it. All of the tables are small and basically 2-person tables. 

If I were rating separately, I'd probably go a 4-star for the service, 3-star for the food, and 2.5 star for the atmosphere. In light of the fact that this is a bit pricey, I'm evening it out at a 3-star rating. There's nothing particularly wrong here, though it's also not a place I'll feel the urge to rush back to. 

After my second Penn Station experience, I've yet to really see how they distinguish themselves other than actually offering fries with their mostly deli selections. 

Overall, I'd likely revisit again if in the building but if in Broad Ripple and not needing to visit this building I'd likely try elsewhere.",1,0,0,0

Sometimes we get them on an off day and the beans inside are not very warm at all and so we have to microwave them to heat them up and melt the cheese. 
Their tacos are delicious, the taco shells are so crunchy and they pack them full of the meat of your choice, lettuce and cheese.

24925,116,4,2019-04-26,"I must be a fan because I've been here, to the Little Greek, on other trips to this area.  It's on Ulmerton, along the hotel/motel strip south of PIE, and specifically between the Burger King and the Red Roof Inn on the south side of the road.  It has its own parking lot shared with several other merchants.  If Burger King and Red Roof Inn aren't adequate enough endpoints, then look for the tacky gold and diamond place (that might advertise on the radio).  It is next door.

Like the name says, it's a fresh grill.  It is fresh in terms of the ingredients that go into the food and how they taste, and not in any impudent way.  It's a grill because this is the way most of their hot dishes are prepared, as opposed to being fried.  That might help explain why you sometimes see photos of centenarians in Greece dressed in black along the cobblestone alleys with whitewashed buildings and all that bougainvillea.  They have subscribed to a Mediterranean diet, with not many deviations from its healthy staples and healthy preparation.

This time around, I ordered the chicken souvlaki platter on a bed of rice with a side Greek salad.  The chicken was tender and grilled to about the right spot.  The rice was nicely seasoned.  I also had a soft drink.  And I also had them put a piece of baklava in a foam clam shell to go but, as soon as I slid behind the steering wheel, I devoured it.  Everything here is tasty.  Also, the prices for desserts are reasonable for this genre of eatery.  This isn't a steak house where you'll pay $7.95 for that slice of cake or pie.  That said, I was mesmerized by the baklava cheesecake.  I had it the last time I was down here and ate at the Little Greek, and it was rich and delicious.  This time, I was ""good"" and summoned the strength to pass on it.

The service has been very good natured.  You order up front, bring the number to your table, and your food will be brought to where you are seated.  You can pour your own soft drink.  The atmosphere inside the Little Greek is nice and fitting for a ""fresh grill"" - big picture windows, simple and modern seating and casework, some photos and graphics of things Greek, and a nice and cool environment ... literally.  It's refreshing to transition from what can be a toasty day in Tampa Bay into this tidy establishment and sit there with your Greek food, a cold soft drink, and contemplate life.

In driving around the Tampa Bay area, it appears that this is a small chain.  There are other stores.  I'm tempted to give them 5 stars but they don't have a sampler platter among their options.  Sometimes, you want a little bit of spanakopita or tiropita without having it be the centerpiece of your meal.  If you are in need of a little souvlaki down in the Sunbelt, check out the Little Greek Fresh Grill along strip mall hell near the airport in Clearwater.",1,0,0,0

24943,113,1,2021-04-21,So I pull up to Taco Bell at 12:30 to order some food their hours on the door state they are open till 1 o'clock online states they are open till 1 o'clock I sit there for 10 minutes as people come out the door don't say nothing to me hop in their cars and just leave I pull around now every light in the building is off everything like that I sat there for 10 minutes before they they left out they could at least have the courtesy to be like hey we're close but they didn't do nothing they had me sit there until I had to figure it out myself they want to close earlyIt's shameful that these people want to get paid more than 725 an hour and bitch about it because they're apparently doing such hard work but yet they cannot stay open until the stated time because they're lazy I wouldn't go to this Taco Bell if my life depended on it anymore everybody there should be fired and just re-staff it with new people and train them because apparently the GM doesn't know what he's doing either if his employees are closing the store early and he can't figure that out from a batch receipt stating that it was batched out at a certain time before closing so you know what I did I went to McDonald's instead that was next-door a matter fact it was pretty fire and you know just because they were open they got me to lunch they got me through lawn quicker than 10 minutes actually quick and that Taco Bell ever gets anybody through the line by the way which takes years to get through that line at Taco Bell no matter what time of day it is because I just royally suck at making food like it's literally tacos dog it's not that hard to make quesadillas not that hard to make none of that food items are hard to make but y'all take 30 minutes for two tacos sometimes it's a pitiful and it's shameful that you really want $15 an hour when y'all can humans can't even do a simple task is just stay open till one if you're in Asheville yeah I know it's close to the airport this by close to your hotel do not order Taco Bell from that placeYou're better off with eating in any other restaurant that's around that area and that Taco Bell hell hit up the taco truck that's a little bit down the road they're way better and it's authentic hell you know what there is a panda express Sue way better net hell you'd get served quicker with food at a sit down restaurant like O'Charleys Ruby Tuesday's if Logan's roadhouse was still around you to get served quicker then if you ate at this Taco Bell,0,1,0,0

If it is open? There's a good chance that one or more of the things you want to order won't be available. Hell, tonight at 11:30 (a full half-hour before closing) we were told that the grills were being cleaned. No apologies given - just that burgers were unavailable.

That's right - McDonald's wasn't able to serve burgers because someone made the choice to clean all the grills at once while they were open.

When asked what other soups they had besides the one advertised, an unidentified male in all black, with no name badge (I assume the mgr) advised me to check the soup station which was tucked in a corner. I got the turkey, kale, wild rice soup size small. I take the bakery paper and reach for a baguette, it was ROCK HARD and SO stale...possibly as old as me because that doesn't happen to baguette that was baked fresh that same day! I didn't get it needless to say. All of the other bread options were gone except an ""everything bread stick"" yuck. I noticed that half the cookie options were gone and a lot of items were out of stock, but the cashiers were too preoccupied with stapling receipts and counting their drawers down to acknowledge me. So...I'm thinking, ""they're about to close, that's why this restaurant looks this way."" That wouldn't be uncommon because a lot of cafes and delis in center city close around since they just open for breakfast and lunch. So I ask the girl, ""what time do you close?"" She replies ""5 o'clock."" What??? Why are there barely any food options here?! Why are you all acting like you're about to close?!

24954,126,4,2016-11-22,"So I decided to check out this place before boarding a flight. At the time, it seemed brand new since there was a lot of construction around the area. Visually the concept is very similar to Chipotle. Single line where you order your food and build out your Mexican dish. 

The food options were pretty identical to Chipotle. Burritos, tacos, and burrito bowls. They didn't seem to have carnitas though. I ordered three soft tacos, and they seemed to be as expected. The seasoning in the chicken was pretty good, and not spicy. But again, just felt like a dumbed-down version of Chipotle. I was disappointed that they wouldn't allow me to order a kids meal, since I wasn't very hungry at all. Pretty lame. Every place I've ever been to never has an issue with this... Hopefully they can be more flexible. 

The service was pretty good, and it didn't seem like a very busy area of the airport. Overall the food and experience is basically on par with what you'd expect at an airport. Nothing incredibly fancy or unique, but a good option if you need to grab a bite before or after traveling.",1,0,0,0

This review is only about the breakfast.  Precious wanted a bite to eat before taking off.  She saw this place.  She got a bowl with scrambled eggs and what they portrayed as chorizo, but let me tell you, it really wasn't chorizo.  It was more like the taco meat from Taco Bell, spicy ground beef.

The eggs were below average, no salt, no taste.  The chorizo [sic] was as described above.  It's one of those meals that you regret having.  There are only so many calories one can eat without getting fat, and we wasted 500 plus or minus on that.

Also, a heads up, I strongly recommend NOT eating here outside of the peak lunch and dinner time.  The food is precooked, and it sits for who knows how long before it is served.

If I can do 3.5 stars I would!  I'm really torn with my rating.  There was no major issues other than the lack of parking spaces and lack of working kiosks.  We had to park at the grocery store and walk over.  Service was good. Everyone was nice.  Place was surprisingly clean for as much business this place drums up.  I like that when I ordered at the kiosk, I was able to Apple Pay and they text my phone when the order is almost complete! Seating is plenty but being a new place...it's always packed. 
Downloading the app is a great idea but it's usually an hour wait for food to be ready.  So plan wisely. 

It's a good burger...don't get me wrong but it wasn't like the most memorable burger.  The chopped cherry topping was tangy.  I love the shake shack sauce.  I also enjoy a flat top cooked burger with a toasted bun with melted cheese.  However my bacon was weird tasting...it's tastes like it was thrown in a deep fryer then stored in the fridge until it's ready to be heated up for the sandwich.  The meat was thinner than I imagined it to be.  I would have loved some options for maybe arugula or adding a fried egg on top...but again...this is a chain burger joint so they may not be able to change their menu like that.   

I didn't get the fries tho bc it's generic fries that I can get anywhere or make at home.  My friend ordered the fries and I tried a few....it was crispy and not greasy.  If this was hand cut fries....I'd be all over it!

25047,139,5,2019-07-25,"First off, I've never had Shake Shack before. However, as a serious burger lover I know about the burger showdowns, comparisons and all that between SS, In n Out, 5 Guys, etc. thanks to YouTube and the multitude of burger fans from coast to coast (and beyond) who are looking for the gold mine of burger joints. Just a little back story, this is the first SS in the state of LA, and it happened to open about 10 minutes from New Orleans in Metairie. So you know this it was extra hype with anticipation because it's Metairie. Not New Orleans. 


I definitely knew I was going to treat my wife and kids to SS, but wanted to wait a few days after open because the place was getting swarmed, even in the rain lines were out the door for those burgers! So I wait a few days and return with the fam, all hungry of course, but to our surprise the line's still out the door. Too late we had to stay now, we already told the kids that's dinner. Can't lie to kids, they don't forget. The good news, is it's pretty efficient. The line moves rather swiftly and once inside I understood this is the least human interactive experience of any burger place I've ever been (maybe ANY restaurant while dining in). Instead of a cashier order-taker person, there are multiple tablet-like communal, podium set ups. Figure it out and help yourself style. You figure out what you want, pay for it, choose here/or to go, all from that tablet spot. Then find a waiting spot and wait on a text/email to tell you come to the front because your food is ready. This process must be addressed to any newbie because it can easily be where the tech challenged folks are most likely to get hung up. I must say it is a good system, it has a flow but the people who are stuck in the past just gotta get with 2019, this is just gonna keep happening get used to it.


On to the food. We all got burgers, plus I added the shroom burger because I simply had to, looked too cool. *Disclaimer* my wife has become a vegetarian for a while and she doesn't do shrooms (in any form), but she was pleasantly in love with the cheese fries. My kids are 10 and 12 years old and they love almost any burger anywhere so I can't base my review off of them. But yes, they absolutely loved it. So this comes down to me. I got a double Shack burger, because I don't waste my time with singles, and bruh. Look at my pics. Yes they are as good as they look! They have a clean taste, fresh, juicy and provide all the good stuff that's on any burger fan's wish list. The bread is supple, soft, and slightly buttery. Now FYI, the patties are not huge, and they're also not small. Wait a sec! Why has no one talked about the pickles?! Their pickles are not run of the mill, I mean I love all pickles but these are a little more higher end and also taste clean and delicious. It all comes together and tastes like quality, plus I didn't feel heavy afterwards.


Lastly, the price reflects what one would pay for a higher end fast food burger. Not a budget breaker, but not dollar menu prices either. I don't eat burgers everyday, but when I'm craving a delicious burger I would absolutely pay $6/$7 at SS again. Maybe even be a man and get a beer next time.",1,0,0,0

I normally avoid new store openings for at least a month due to long lines and crowded spaces. However, I just couldn't wait to visit Shake Shack. 

I ordered the chick n shack sandwich, cheese fries, and shack attack concrete. 

The chick n shack sandwich was a crispy chicken sandwich with just the right about of breading and flaky crust. The combination of the signature mayo, tangy pickles, and soft bun create a chicken sandwich that blows chick-fil-a away! 

The cheese fries are to die for! The salty, crinkle cut fries paired with a house made cheese sauce is quite addicting. 

The shack attack concrete is an easy one to love. A mix of brownies, chocolate chunks and fudge sauce blended into the signature custard is to die for! 

I highly recommend you try The new shake shack on Veterans Blvd. It was very crowded and hard to find seating due to just opening. However, the staff did not disappoint.

I downloaded the app and placed a mobile order for pickup. My pickup time was 30 minutes later which is beyond reasonable given the current popularity of this establishment. There was one open spot when I pulled into the lot (thank you, Jesus). There was still a line that goes outside of the restaurant as of three days ago. Granted, it was a Sunday at 5:30pm. I walked inside right past the line outside and went to the pickup counter which is right next to the register. I was two minutes early, so I let an employee know I was there. She told me to step to the side and she would let me know when it was ready. One minute later, I received a text saying my order was ready as I saw it being placed on the pickup counter by an employee. Previous employee handed me my order. Super easy pickup experience. As I turned around to leave, there was a FIVE GUYS employee picking up a large order. The Shake Shack manager chuckled and thanked him for coming in as he directed him to the condiments.

I've eaten Shake shake at different locations to compare consistency, flavor, cleanliness, etc.. so far, of my 3 dine ins, they have kept it very friendly, clean and fast pace. My second dine in, i found my burger to be overly salty which was a let down. The fries have been cooked perfectly each time. There are always workers going around cleaning tables to ensure the next guests find seats promptly. I also like how they have many kiosks when ordering food to help make ordering and adjusting food options easier. There is also a register open for anyone wanting to pay cash, since all kiosks are more card friendly. When completing your order, they ask for your cellphone number which sends out a text telling you that your order is ready for pick up. Overall, since the hype has died down, it is finally turned into a place to get a quick burger now instead of waiting in line for a good 15+ minutes.

My go-to order is the ShackBurger and cheese fries +/- a vanilla malt. They do have seasonal shakes that change every so often too! Right now they have a pie flavor and black sesame. Service is very quick and friendly. Someone saw us walking toward a table and came to wipe it down for us without us even asking! The line also moves quickly despite how long it has been recently.

Only downside to this location is the limited parking. You can always park across the street at the mall and walk over though. Lines have been out the door because it's so new, so if you are not about the crowd life ... wait it out a few weeks! Alternatively, you can download the online Shake Shack app and order for pickup. They let you choose a time slot and are pretty prompt with the order. Only downside is you can only order a max of two items per category via the app. For example... 2 Shackburgers, 2 fries, 2 shakes.

The burger and fries were great BUT I think the total meal warranted an $11 price point. Also, what's up with those miniature buns? My burger was hanging off of it. The custard was full of praline, toffee and chocolate sauce...almost too much lol! I was initially shocked by the cost of almost $5, but it was nicely done. It's worth noting that I waited 5 minutes from the time of placing my order to getting it. I like the ""text when ready"" feature, but it still took another minute or so for my order to be ready after I got the text.

25087,139,3,2019-09-15,"I struggled to decide how to assign a star review to this place since we go so far back that I'd previously been one of the first customers at the stand in Madison Square Garden in NYC and more recently, the location on 8th Avenue across from the Row Hotel.

But it has been a few years and they have rapidly expanded. I didn't make it to the new location here in Metairie until today and we ordered 2 cheeseburgers, one double cheeseburger (mine), a shake, one order of fries, and 2 lemonades. Total cost, almost $35.00.

And I will say upfront, honestly, that the food quality and the service are excellent. The burger was delicious, with a great bun and a nicely browned exterior. I enjoy a thinner burger that has some ""texture"" to the exterior more than a thicker ""New Orleans style"". I also partook in a salted caramel shake which was excellent as well. And the staff was great; very customer service oriented, and the restaurant was spotless, as they apparently staff enough to have some ""floor walkers"" who keep tabs on the customer environment. A++ 100% there.

However, my only reason for knocking it down one star is one that the local restaurant probably has very little control over: the fries and the portion sizes for the price. Now, don't get me wrong, the fries were fresh and well cooked and salted perfectly. There just weren't very many of them in a serving and they were clearly Ore-Ida type crinkle fries from a bag.

And the burgers are, in my opinion, tiny, very akin to other restaurant's $1 or $1.49 double cheeseburgers. I'd probably need to eat two doubles to be truly ""full."" And at $8 for a basic double cheeseburger, that'd be a steep meal price. I saw a kids burger on the menu and I can only imagine that must be a slider basically.

So, in short, the local restaurant staff is excellent and turns out a great product, but the corporate portion sizing left a bit more to be desired.",1,0,0,0
25088,139,3,2019-08-08,"I finally decided to stop as the line was not outside. Like many have said, there are self serve kiosks inside and only 2 worked. There were at least 8 total but only 2 worked.  Then when I got to the kiosk it said for debit or credit and I was paying with cash. There was an employee just standing next to the line so I asked what should I do since I was paying with cash. She said just go to the counter. I stood in line for at least 10 minutes and watched 5 employees behind the counter standing around doing nothing. That was a little confusing.
I gave my order to the lady and told her exactly what I did not want on my burger and then I went to the restroom which could have used some attention. When my buzzer went off I went to get my food and discovered it was not how I requested. So I had them remake it. It was still not what I requested and at this point I was wondering if these employees were able to read, were lazy, were not trained properly, or what. Two burgers went into the trash.
As for the food once I finally received the correct order. The burger was good. It was smaller than expected but taste great. In the future, I will pass on the lemonade, the milkshake, the fries and the chicken bites. Better can be found elsewhere. So that means I would only get the burger again and I would actually need two since they are sort of small or maybe I would need to get the double. 
The parking is limited but hopefully once the newness is over space will be available.

25119,139,5,2019-08-01,"I've never been so happy about a place coming to New Orleans... EVER. When I heard a shake shack was opening near us, I was over the moon. I first tried it in Dallas then Chicago and it NEVER lets me down. Dang good every single time. 

This particular location was smaller than I expected. It's pretty dang crowded and a bit hectic in my opinion. Parking is pretty limited too so be prepared for that. My friend and I parked at breaux mart and walked over. I also said I didn't want to go for a while to let the craze die down, but I couldn't handle my cravings and honestly, will the craze ever die?! 

When you walk in, there's a line leading up to tablet devices you order off of. There's a worker around helping assist the flow of the line and it moves pretty quickly. I like this option as you're able to order and pay with card there or you can also I think print a receipt and pay at register. This also gives you the option to make your burger or fries a little more customizable. You enter your phone number after your order is complete and they'll text you to let you know your order is ready as well as call your name out loud. 

I had the single smoke shack that has a single patty, cheese, cherry pepper relish and Niman Ranch applewood smoked bacon. I added pickles because I love pickles. My friend has a double shack burger which is patty, cheese, tomato, lettuce and shack sauce. We shared an order of cheese fries as well. I don't know why, but I LOVE their buns. So soft and buttery. I love the cherry pepper relish as it adds a sweet, very slight hot tang to the burger. Bacon is good as well. It all works together so well, it's easily one of my favorite burgers. Cheese fries are average for me. Crinkle cut fries with cheese sauce on top. Not a lot of flavor, but simple enough and still tasty. 

Overall, my food was great, but the atmosphere was lacking. It was just too packed inside and people were often waiting for tables which kind of feels awkward just standing around. There's seating outside, but the summer heat now isn't ideal for that. The workers were all nice and helpful esp one guy who's name I didn't catch that took our trash when we were done and asked if we needed anything else.

Now on to the cons.  The lines..  you have to wait in a line to get into the line inside.   I don't blame them though.  I think the lines are caused by people not knowing how to use the ordering kiosks.  There was a person behind a register but I'm not sure if they were there to take cash orders or not.   They really should have someone posted by the kiosks to help out with people ordering their food.  Another complaint I have is when they text you that your order is ready, you go over there and there are other people standing there waiting for food and I wasn't sure what to do even though my food was ready.

I love that you can order your meal in a computer and then get a text message when its ready. Because it just opened there is a long line but the waiting time to order on a Saturday afternoon was not that long.

Last time I ate in one of these burger joints it was in NYC. They only had a lettuce wrap burger available for those needing a GF meal but now they have stepped it up... they actually have a GF bun and it is delicious. Its not hard as a rock like other GF buns I have tried. 

I had the Smoked Shack in GF bun. I loved it! It was the perfect size for me. I also enjoyed the bacon and spicy kick to it during my fina bites. 

My friends ordered a cheese burger and fries. For them it was to small and had to order a second one to be completely satisfied. 

The crinkle fries are OK... not my favorite. I prefer them to be a bit fresher and softer...everyone else enjoyed them and finished them off for me.

They also have delicious lemonade and milkshakes. 
My strawberry milk shake was a perfect combination to my burger.

so it's a shake shack! i don't think it's worth a line, but if you happen to be in the area at an odd hour you'll have a better chance of being able to park and sit down for one of the famed burgers...otherwise be prepared to circle like an angry suburban hawk (i'm guessing they are trying to work out parking from the chinese spot next to it, but overall just isn't a good location for the volume of business they will have).

the staff was nice and quick. overall it's just a little cramped. you walk up to a set of kiosks to basically place your order at a tablet and then your phone buzzes with a text that your order is being prepared, then you get another when you can walk up to the pick up window. this is cool, but also could be confusing if you're not used to this method. there is a traditional walk-up line.

i went all in and got the deep fried mushroom cheese thing on top of a patty -- beware! i mean, it's deep fried cheese, but just watch out. that's basically lava, so if you have kids (or adults who act like kids) with you and that's their order, they should proceed with caution. otherwise i actually really liked the fries, nice crunch still with a little chew. they messed up my drink (well actually an upgrade), so while i can't tell you how i enjoyed the rootbeer, i can tell you that i've never had an orange float with a burger and it wasn't bad (think, creamsicle).

I've eaten at Shake Shack several times in other states, so I was very familiar with the regular menu items. I decided to try something new so I ordered the Shackmeister burger, fries and the hot cocoa shake. I dined in and the customer service and speed of service were great. The fries and shake were excellent, but I didn't feel like the Shackmeister burger was worthy of the higher price. The fried shallots didn't stand out; they just felt and tasted like fried flour bits on top, albeit nicely seasoned flour bits. 
Tonight was my second visit. I placed my order in the app and picked up from the line outside. Now, I was expecting some sort of instruction on how to pick up my order given the current social distancing rules. But my in-app order confirmation just gave a time that my order would be ready. I parked about two minutes after that time, got out of my car and joined the line. I was greeted immediately by an employee who asked for my name and the names of the others who had just joined the line. Others received their orders quickly, but mine didn't seem
to be ready. I started reading the social distancing signs that they have taped to the ground and the one at the very front of the line said that customers would receive a text when their order is ready. Ahhh... I hadn't received a text yet, so I went back to my car. Upon checking my email I saw that the order confirmation email also said to wait for a text. It would make sense to also have a message pop up in the app telling customers to wait for the text before getting in line; not everyone will read the confirmation email when they already have a confirmation in the app. 
The burger this second time was excellent. I ordered the double shack burger and added bacon, pickle and onion. I also had fries. The fries were lukewarm, which was disappointing. I don't live far away, so the wait to get home wasn't the issue. Furthermore, the burger was much warmer than the fries, so I could tell that the finish times on the two just weren't in sync. 
What was really odd about this visit was how the takeout order was assembled. The burger was just open in the bag, and the bag was completely open (see picture). Coronavirus aside, I think food should be handed off closed for takeout. I did notice a plastic film near the bag's handles when I threw it away later. Perhaps it's the customer's job to peel that off to seal the bag.

And their fries? If you like spicy stuff, get their Spicy fries. You can choose the level of spiciness and for someone who lives for spicy stuff, the hottest hits the spot. I just wish you can choose bigger sizes because I don't want to be the guy who gets two fries with my order.

I've ordered twice through the app and both times I've had to wait thirty minutes to an hour past the supposed pickup time outside of the store to get my food. Also this is chipotle, all the food is cooked, it just needs to be assembled. The system is bonkers, they make you wait for an employee to come out who you then have to flag down so they can take your name and then eventually start your order. The first time they were only accepting online orders because they were short staffed and COVID precautions, both of which are understandable, however it seems so strange to not just start the orders as they come in. The second time I came they were allowing people in and they served them immediately, pushing aside all online orders, even if you had put in a name. They also won't let you pick it up in store, despite the directions on the chipotle app. You instead have to wait for whenever an employee collects enough orders to bring them out, so they sit and get cold before it even gets to you. When you're letting people in to order, why can't people come in to pick up their food, you have the shelf for it already? Again, the food is fine but given how many people order takeout they should improve the pickup system.

I prepared for a few phone calls and FB scrolling but was surprised to find staff ready, and prepared for the crowd.  They ushered us in faster than I thought possible and inside, I could see why.

Aside from being welcoming, handing out ponchos and expediting the line, there is are about 6-8 order pads for easy self service order placement.  You provide a phone number and get a text when your order is up.  Crazy convenient.  

We tried the regular cheese burger, bacon burger, Haydels Pie concrete and a salted caramel milk shake with cheese fries and a regular fry (had to get in a little of everything).  The burgers were exceptional for that old fashioned style burger.  No complaints.  The shake and concrete were also wonderful.  I liked the cheese fries more than I expected.

We waited until the newness and hype died down and tried it a few weeks ago. The ENTIRE was uber friendly and helpful, it is the main reason I give this place 4 out of 5 stars. I ordered the burger with the crispy onion rings and was not disappointing with the taste, but the size. It was nearly the size of a slider. It was me and my husband and we had two burgers, two shakes and one small in size side of fries and it was around $45. The shake I got was very good and I like that they are putting local ingredients in it from Willa Jeans. 

I was disappointed at first because there was a brownie shake I had set my heart on, and if you've read any of my reviews, my BIGGEST pet peeve in a restaurant is for them to not tell me FROM THE START if they are out of something. Because most of the time, I will go out of my way to go to a certain restaurant for a SPECIFIC item, and if they are out of said item, I would prefer to know up front and leave. So, my husband had already ordered and so I couldn't just leave. The manager was on top of his game though. He quickly recommended a toffee shake that he felt was even better in taste than the brownie one, he also assured me that if I was not satisfied, we would get a shake that made me happy. The shake came out and I was happy with it. I think the manager went above and beyond, I wish I knew his name, but he deserves a raise.

I like the options of payment because it makes splitting checks or having groups easier. They have the counter service for cash only customers and the machines for credit card paying customers. The machines are similar to those you see at AMC Theatres, you select items on a touch screen an slide your card. I like that they have custard in their shakes too. We were missing that in Metairie.

I'm a shake shack fan from the multiple locations in Phoenix, so when I saw they were opening a location here I knew it would be worth a try. 

I ordered the ""SmokeShack"". The burger was just ""ok"". I love a good burger, especially one that's a good size and juicy. The burger patty was not seasoned well. Just tasted bland. They use American cheese which is fine. The ""Applewood Smoked Bacon"" was not smoked at all but just plain bacon. And the cherry peppers were sour and bitter tasting. The bun of the burger was also mushy and too soft. 

The side of fries I ordered tasted frozen. the strawberry lemonade was TOO SWEET. And, I wanted to order a chocolate shake but they were out!

Colbies is a little pricey for a fast food restaurant. A sandwich, fries, and drink will set you back over $10. That's a little steep in my opinion. They do over free refills on drinks and the fries are pretty good, but the chicken sandwich was short of my expectation. I think it has a lot to do with the bun. It was just too big for the chicken breast. I got the hot chicken sandwich, and somehow, there was something missing in the flavor, and I tasted far too much bun.

How about if in that scenario you were told that you were in for a Burger experience of epic proportions? I'm talking about the type of experience that would make a Vegetarian eat meat kind of experience, or at least that was the hype man's way of hyping up this Burger. Well this ain't that type of party. In fact when I see him I just might hit him in his throat for suggesting it. I am at a loss as to why any person in of all places, New Orleans, would find a need to wait in line for a Burger at Shake Shack! Ok, at best it was really just ok. The size of my Burger was less than the size of a 99 cent hamburger on most Menus. Now I know size isn't everything, ( Gigidy) but as  Randy Moss would say, ""Comonmaaan"". The Shake was better than the Burger to me. Change the name to, oh wait, Shake is in the name with no mention of it being a preferred Burger joint. (Y'all didn't see that coming huh)? I won't be in a rush to head back for a second chance. I'm afraid I might run into the person that suggested this spot and end up going home with a Misdemeanor Assault. I have to say though the service was excellent. If your looking for fantastic service, great Milk Shakes and mediocre Burgers, head on down to Shack Shack on Veterans Blvd in Metairie La. In fact head over to one near you because they are popping up all over the place.

The shack stack was good and juicy but not worth going out of your way for. On a scale of 1 to 10...we give it a 7. 

These cheese fries were a miss. The cheese sauce they used seemed way too watery and tasteless.

They have menus posted on the wall and you order at tablets located along the counter. Its a bit impersonal but not that big of a deal. You pay on the tablet and get a receipt. The people at the counter probably take cash payments. They call out your number when your food is ready.

I can't believe it's been 5 months since they've been open, but I finally took the trek to Metairie, on a Saturday. 
First off, the location is too small! When they announced Shake Shack was coming to New Orleans, I thought they were going to take over the former New Orleans Daiquiri shop in front of Lakeside Mall, which is now Charles Schwab. Shake Shack has the lot across the street which was formally Jaegars. Parking is a pain. You have to enter from Vets and there are maybe 16 - 20 parking spots in the front lot, and 6 spots around back. Next door at The Egg Roll House, there are multiple signs about not parking there if you're not an Egg Roll House customer. So, I don't think I would risk parking in another lot. Luckily, I was able to wait in the parking lot for a car to come out and took the spot. If you happen to be shopping at Lakeside Mall, I would honestly just keep your car there and walk across the street as to not hassle with the parking lot.
Also, this location supports mobile ordering, so you can order online and pick up in store with little to no wait time. 

Ordering is pretty easy, one line for cash where you pay at the register with an employee, and one line for card and mobile payments (Google or Apple Pay). I think there were about 8 self payment kiosks, and half of them were out of order. You order, customize and pay on the kiosk and the system will send you a text once your order is ready. There is outdoor seating under awnings, and pretty ample seating inside.

Anyways, the hubby got Nashville Hot Sandwich combo and I went for the chicken tenders. Simple to start since I don't know what to expect. Like the previous review, it's something about that bun! Cheap-like and not worth to consume. Thank goodness for my tenders though. Visually not appealing as they looked overly fried, but once bitten into its very moist and juicy. Not dry at all. Nice dip with the thai chili sauce. We shared the sweet potato crinkles. The mallow dip wasn't our thing.

The process of placing your order on a kiosk was a great concept unless you have someone taking too long to decide what to get like me..lol After placing your order, you would wait for a text message telling you when to head over to the counter to pick up your food. I didn't feel like having a meat burger so I went for a Shroom Burger, crisp-fried portobello mushroom filled with melted muenster and cheddar cheeses, topped with lettuce, tomato and Shack sauce. I love it but would ask for more Shack sauce next time. We shared the Chick'n Bites. Crispy hand-breaded chicken breast with BBQ sauce, almost as good as Chick-fil-A nuggets. We also had the cheese fries topped with blend of cheddar and American cheese sauce. Their crinkle cut fries remind me of Raising Canes fries. My nephew had the shake and he says its good but nothing to brag about. I had the Oh My Concrete, a vanilla custard blended with pieces of Haydel's bakery seasonal pie.

25283,139,2,2019-07-23,"IMHO! I'm usually pretty much a compulsive Yelper!

If the line is ""to the pole"" that is an hour wait. (20-25 people)  They only have (3-4) kiosks open & are taking orders by staff.  The burgers are ""slightly larger"" than a Crystal burger.  I think  that it is more of a fad.

The best part of the entire meal was the ""concrete"" dessert.  I guess the overall theme of the restaurant is recycling combined with tech can make the user experience much better.  I prefer to view it as the movie ""The experimenter"" based upon Yale psychology professor Stanley Milgram. 

When you walk down a street and everyone is looking up, you look up to see what they are looking for.  Milgram proved that ""peer pressure"" can influence individuals, just like shake shack does.  Because this place has a customary ""line out the door"" - it encourages others to wait in line.  Because some of the kiosks are down (they are ready but not logged in for use) they ""Create the illusion that this burger is in high demand "".  It is a brilliant ""blue light special"" type of marketing that draws in the millennial crowd.  

The truth is that they are ""understaffed"" and ""overworked"". (Although there are two employees that just STAND NEXT TO THE LINE!!!  Like ""it's ok , I'm waiting an hour here with you.  Truth be told, other places are a better value.  I sincerely felt when I left that place I would have been better off (health, time, monetary) getting Mediterranean food down the street (you can deduce which one from my profile check-ins)

So if Yelp! ""scrubs this review"" because I honestly express my ""true user experience"" I am done  
I could name a 1/2 dozen hamburger places that are better than this place.  But if you want to eat somewhere ""just because it is a fad"" - feel free!!! 

P.S.- please look  at the photos and notice the scale of the bun is only slightly larger than a teaspoon.  In all actuality the bun is about 2""x 2"" and the lettuce  was slightly larger than a silver dollar.  The bacon was exactly (4) strips - 3 in a row with one  on the end!",1,0,0,0

I work in the plaza and have enjoyed coming in and getting my lunch and chatting quickly with the friendly employees who I see quite often. This all changed when a few months ago I went in to get a sandwich after my shift at work. The next day a police officer stopped in at my place of work to question me about a subway employees phone being stolen off the counter. Since I had been in at that time the employee suspected that I had taken it. I told the officer that I had seen the phone on the counter and it was still there when I took my sandwich and left. I understand that since I was in around the time of the theft that they may have had questions for me but I did not appreciate being treated like I stole from one of their employees when that was not the case at all. After the incident the staff was rude to the other people I work with who continued to come in as if we had did something wrong. The officer told me he would let me know when he had further information on the situation and I never heard anything.

When they served us our food there was cheese on both sandwiches.   My mom politely asked if they could be remade due to her allergy. They reluctantly  obliged and were shown the receipt to prove they were ordered without cheese. 
When she got the new burgers, she opened the bun to add extra ketchup and was very shocked by the placement of the pickles. There was a phallic object  (penis) made with the pickles two normal pickles and one long pickle in the center.   This very inappropriate, rude and beyond offensive.

One was pumping cheese-like material onto some fries (my excitement about the bacon cheese fries that I just ordered dipped when I saw the cheez), one was taking an order, one was doing busy work, and one was talking to them. At least one or two of them saw, and ignored, the man standing there holding up his driver's license with a look of 'can you help me'? So...I went back to the kiosk and canceled my beer and got a soft drink. It's really not nice to separate me from my beer, especially when it's with a burger, but I endured.
The three of us all liked our burgers. In fact, on this first visit, my burger was great. It's in the realm of a Mooyah burger, but this one was definitely better than Mooyah. The bacon/cheez whiz fries were good-ish. The bacon was good. The cheez was sloppy and eventually got clumpy and cheezwhizy. 
By the way, as I ate, I did see the girl who looked at me and ignored me earlier go over to a kiosk to help someone, and I'm thinking that was the beer process actually working. So it just wasn't my day, I guess.

Overall, we loved our burgers, but didn't really like the place that much. 

So, I did a Yelp review. And they followed up very quickly with a very nice apology and an e-gift card, asking for a second chance. I was impressed enough to take down my review and go back. Clean slate.

So...I go back and go to the counter. I had my e-card displayed on my phone and asked first if they could use it. The cashier didn't know, so she asked the lady next to her, who very flatly and matter-of-factly said ""no, our scanner won't read those."" When I asked if they could manually enter the digits, she said no, again, very flatly and unapologetically. The cashier did seem very disappointed and definitely apologized. I went ahead and ordered anyhow, and the cashier was again, very apologetic. 
So, I paid $17 for a burger, fries (no cheez), and a beer (which I got!).

The beer was really good. The fries were okay-ish. And this burger just wasn't as good as the last. This was the Smoke Shack burger by the way, and it's good, but my second impression of the burger was not nearly as good as my first.

So...because of a service issue on my first visit, they got me back with a gift card for a second visit, and that didn't work. Then I paid $17 for a 'better-than-fast-food' burger, beer and fries, and it was very underwhelming. 
And by the way, I am certain I could go to one of my 2 or 3 ""quality burger"" places and get a true gourmet burger (with a side) and a beer, for roughly the same price. 

So...not sure if I need to go back, but I end with this:
It's a chain ""convenience"" restaurant, which means different expectations. It's semi-fast. It's not bad.  That's why I'm giving 3 stars even with my complaints. And they do have beer. So...I may drop in spontaneously one day when I'm craving a simple burger and beer.

Maybe.

I walked in and said my name for pick up. She must've not seen my name on her computer because response was ""What's the confirmation number?"".  I told her that I see an order number on my online receipt.  She said no I need the confirmation number in an assertive tone. (I found out later that they're the same number).

from the counter, found the extras we needed at the condiment/utensil station and brought our goodies to the table to check them out.

We each had burgers and shared 2 orders of fries between the 4 of us. We had 2 fountain drinks, 2 bottled waters and a small shake, and the total was $45.

We visited roughly 2 weeks into quarantine and ordered on the app then picked up at the front door. They were out of fries which was kind of a bummer, but they had shakes and burgers, so that was the important part. They also had the new chicken nuggets at this location, but for me, they were a hard pass. Nothing extraordinary. What was extraordinary as I remembered though? The Shack Stack and the salted caramel shake. The Shack Stack was perfectly seasoned, hot without being volcanic when I bit into the cheesy stuffed mushroom and a great balance of textures between the crisp mushroom and the juicy burger. I added red peppers this time and it was a nice little kick of flavor. The shake was cold and sweet and salty and exactly what I wanted after that heavy burger.

My first trip I got chicken tenders, cheese curds, and a sweet tea. The tea had a weird flavor, almost like Lipton Brisk, the curds were cold and gummy, and the chicken was just bland and overly crisped on the outside.

Second trip I tried a chicken sandwich, green bean fries, and the sweet potato fries with mallow dip. The sandwich was ok, but nowhere near as a good as Popeyes, Chick Fil A, or even Burger King's new one. The green bean fries were cold and lacked any flavor aside from batter and whatever sauce you dipped them in (I got the ranch, very meh). The sweet potato fries were again cold, but actually good. I would say they are the one item i've tried that I would actually order again.

My most recent trip was yesterday and I decided to switch it up and try some breakfast items (served all day). I went with biscuits and gravy with sausage, and french toast dip sticks. The biscuits were ok, the gravy was a bit too thick but tasted ok, but the sausage was downright bad. Weird color, weird texture, and bad taste. I think I ate half of one piece of sausage before pulling it off and eating just biscuit and gravy. The french toast sticks were good, but of course cold, and not really any different or better than the frozen french toast sticks from a grocery store.

The lemonade, to me, as very sweet. Reminiscent of simply lemonade.

The shack burger was good but messy for a lettuce wrapped option.

The chicken sandwich was a disappointment. the chicken had no flavour. it tasted like they fried it but forgot to season it.

That's a lot of staff for a dead restaurant. We did drive thru because it was empty but it still took some time to make our food. Not super quick for a drive thru option.
I got the original chicken sandwich. It had 2 top buns. The breading on the chicken was so gosh dang thick I couldn't even see the inside of the chicken until halfway through the sandwich. 
My husband had the Nashville Hot. It had 2 bottom buns. He said the sauce somehow had barely any flavor and it just wasn't good. His chicken was super dry while mine wasn't dry necessarily, but it wasn't very juicy either.
Also the chicken was overly sweet for both? I've had some chicken with a bit of sweetness but wow I felt like I was biting into some sugar.
We got a large side of fried green beans as well. If the size they gave us was a large, I'd hate to see a small. There were maybe 10 green beans total. And they were burnt. The ranch helped a little but there wasn't much going on really.

Ok, so you know everyone want to try the ""new"" place, but really, I had no idea it was ""new"" until I searched yelp-looking for a place to get a club sandwich.  For whatever reason Shake Shack popped up in the search and showed it was a  place right now and a new establishment, so.... why not.   I ordered 6 pc chicken bites and chicken sandwich sauce on side.  I asked the young lady, what size was chicken breast? 3oz, 4oz? She stated she wasn't sure... ""Can you ask please?"" She come back- Sorry, nobody knows because they come in different sizes. (Isn't that what I asked!?). I replied-""That's what I asked Hun, do what are those ""sizes""?""  She held up her fingers together, in a circle and said - ""About this size..."". I was speechless. Like-Where am I! . Nevermind, Let me just try it.  M thinking... Being a previous restaurant owner, an establishment should know the size of their food. . Anyhoo... They gave you a buzzer for when meal was ready.  I heard my name being yelled... Looked up and they were waving me to come get my food (the buzzer never went off until I got 1/2 way to register).  I mentioned to young lady and she stated.... ""It does that; it goes off about 30 secs after we hit submit."" Me thinking again - Ummmm, maybe you need to work on that glitch. ‍

So, sat down... taste bites-they seem ok, but then I taste all grease and crust... I peel off fried to get better taste and it's just ""ok"". Nope! Not what I was expecting... I peeled the other 5 bites and they were like peanuts underneath all the fried. They were $6!!! I was feeling queezy after eating them, so I chased taste w/water. Now, I open bun for chicken sandwich... wow! Wow! . Terrible. It was a chunk of fried mini ball.  . I was thinking ... there are mini sandwiches or something.. For the price, awful! I peeled off the fried off the chicken breast... then I thought... I can't eat this... I will save for tomorrow and just eat the breast as my protein. It seriously looked like a knot.  Crazy!  I packed it up and left. Disappointed!!!! 

Now hours later feeling queezy again!!!! Now mouth fills with water and I bolt to the restroom and  the bites up! Ohhhh my!!! Awful feeling when you have a dry , but I'm glad it's up!!!  They should stick to shakes! 

Safe yourself a trip/experience/time/money and just eat at Chick fil a (for chicken sandwich) or Atomic Burger (for an amazing turkey burger-small, but worth every bite).  So, there! There you have my review at 2:04 AM! . It's not worth the disappointment/time and MONEY! Gross! Between 6 nuggets and a baby chicken sandwich it was little over $11.

First things first, this location is simply too small. I'm aware that I visited within the first couple of weeks of it opening, but this spot has the ability to get crowded very quickly. I saw a sign on the door where the capacity is around 128 and that explained a lot. When I stopped by yesterday around 6pm, people were hanging out the door. Once I popped inside I realized why: ordering kiosks. 

I'm a big fan of tech making its way into the fast food industry in terms of food ordering. It proves to be quick, aids in making sure your order is customized from extra pickles to no tomato and of course, because I'm a millennial and it's fun. (Who doesn't like looking at a digital display of every single menu item before selecting???) But technology isn't foolproof. This location had 3 ordering kiosks that worked out of maybe 10-12. This held up the line a bunch. And not only that, but older people ordering or those not so familiar with such technological ordering advances had a rough time ordering a simple burger. I could even overhear people complaining about this while in line. I do want to shoutout Shake Shack for having a designated person that helped with the kiosks though, its very appreciated and necessary. Other than these hang-ups, I like the screen ordering aspect. You can swipe your card and all. They text you once your order is done. And also call your name that you input at the kiosks.

Since the line was super long and there weren't many seats, I went with a to-go order and I got it pretty fast. I ordered two ShackBurgers, an order of fries, a small chocolate shake and one of the custards that had toffee, chocolate and mentioned the term ""Haydel's Bakery"" so of course, I was all in.

The food was just as great as I remembered. No complaints at all. Everything on the burger tastes fresh, from the patty down to the super soft bun. Not only that, but it feels like a clean burger; not super greasy, no limp lettuce and the sauce is banging. The fries were crispy and not greasy which was also a plus. Yes, this is a place where you will get $5-7 burgers and shakes for a higher price than you would someplace else, but I do think the quality is worth it. Overall, I'll probably find myself visiting Shake Shack more now that we have one, especially once the downtown location opens in Canal Place!",1,0,0,0
25411,142,5,2016-03-18,"I come here periodically, and I have to say that the food is superb. Everything I order comes out right the first time and the wait staff is very friendly and professional. Either day or late night, the staff does not disappoint. I feel that they actually care about me.

But, this morning I went through, and this is only my 2nd ""Yelp"" review in 4 years, but I just had to point out the exceptional service of a person named ""Chris"".  I forgot to ask for curly fries when I ordered at the speaker. I also forgot to ask for my milkshake without the toppings as well. I ALSO paid with a $100 bill...

When I realized my mistakes, it was AFTER I'd ordered at the speaker,  and I dreaded having to go to the window to fix my mistakes.  But, Chris was so kind about it and I REALLY appreciated it.  He didn't make me feel uncomfortable or ""stupid"" or inconvenienced.  

I think THAT is what good customer service is about.  I think that everyone should know about it, because sometimes you don't hear about the good stuff, ya know?

First off, I had to repeat my order 4 different times before they got it (not right). 
And I know Jack in the Box drive through line is usually long, but tonight was RIDICULOUS!
The entire order for the car in front of me was wrong. So after they sent it back, we all waited another 35 mins for them to remake their food. Once they got their food and a small refund they drove off. I pull up and my food is already sitting by the window. Along with my soda and shake.

I just got done fixing another no ice and now I have to do it again.""
I let it slide. I understood she was already having a rough night. I was happy with how quickly my food was prepared and waiting for me. When I drove off I reached in my bag to grab a taco. Jack in the Box tacos are hard shell and deep fried...my taco was flimsy and COLD. It sat by the window the whole time the car in front of me had to send back their food. 35 mins my food sat by the drive thru window getting COLD!

My roommates and I had just finished a night at a comedy show where we had been drinking a little and wanted to get some quick food before we went home (we're grandmas, so this was around 8:45pm). Now I know that Jack in the box isn't like some 5 star high end quality food, but when you go through a fast food drive thru, the ONE thing you want out of the whole experience is to get your food FAST. 

We ordered around 8:45pm, and when we got to the window, we waited about 5 full minutes before the guy came out and took our card to pay. We're still waiting there for our food (our order was pretty standard by the way: 3 orders of curly fries, a burger, chicken strips. Nothing complicated.)
15 minutes later, we still don't have our food. The guy says they're ""swamped"" and only have 3 people working, and asks us if we can pull around to the front of the restaurant and he'll bring our food out to us. That just sounded weird to me but of course we do it because we don't know any better and we really thought that by listening to this employee that we would get our food like, at a decent time. We're waiting outside parked in front of this freaking establishment for about 30 minutes, it's about 9:30pm. My friend walks in and stands in front of the counter to see what's up. There's NOT that many people inside (like maybe 4 people waiting for their food). Also, I understand if you're understaffed and ""swamped."" But doesn't it make sense to give the people food who ordered it first??? Like why would you keep making other people's orders if there's clearly people who have already paid for their food and still haven't gotten it? Like if you're swamped, just stop taking orders at the drive thru for a second and make someone's food.

They tried to give us a free cheesecake slice at around 9:40 when they finally started packing our food together. I ended up asking the employee if it was okay to get a full refund, because this was unreasonable to wait 45 minutes to get food and have to bug the employees over and over to not forget that we were still waiting. The manager came out and thankfully refunded me on my card (I haven't actually gotten it yet but she said it would take a couple days).

The Chef Menteur location is within walking distance from my home.

On MULTIPLE occasions I've been asked to backup and pull up again to reset the drive their drive thru timer. On last week I was asked to pull forward and my food would be brought to my car; the wait was for spicy strips. On that occasion I waited 10 mins and the order brought to me was of such poor quality I just had to get something else for my son. Strips were hot and fresh but the fries were slightly warm and I didn't receive the drink. I parked and went inside to collect the drink. I was told there would be an additional three (3) min wait for fries. I just took the loss. 

On today, I have decided that we will NEVER patronize this establishment again! On today we ordered four (4) Apple pies. I pulled an apple pie from the sleeve to find a strand of HAIR connected to/coming from the pie!!!! The hair also contained the batter indicating that it had been fried with the pie. I am outraged. I'm also nauseous and disgusted. I feel so many things right now.

Bad idea.

Whoever was taking orders for the drive-thru at first did not have her mic up to her mouth to where I could hear her. I thought she gave me the okay to order after asking a quick question. Heard a small mumbling from the speaker, then I finally informed her that I could not hear her. ""I'M HELPING ANOTHER CUSTOMER, WAIT!""

Oh, okay.. 

Another girl gets on the mic and begins to take my order. The order on the screen isn't matching up to what I've said so I just make sure that she's getting it down right. ""Yes, yes, I heard you,"" in a snide tone. 

Pull up to the window and apologize for not being able to hear them, as if it's my fault they didn't have their mic up to where customers could hear. No response. Ask for ranch with my bag, see the girl with ranch in her hand, assume it's put in my bag. As I pull away, I realize there isn't any ranch in my bag.

I go inside and ask probably the first woman who took my order for ranch. She walks over to the mom fridge where the ranch is, pulls it out AND PLACES IT ON THE OPPOSITE END OF THE COUNTER INSTEAD OF WALKING FIVE STEPS SHE REALLY NEEDS TO PUT IT IN MY HAND.

I enjoy eating here from time to time accept some dude sat across from me and ate with his mouth opened. Got mayo on his mangey beard, and got eye contact with me way to many times. So it's the area that attracts people of all incomes especially homeless people. 

The meal was just as expensive as a high class burger joint, 8 bucks for most of the meals. Where did the dollar menu go? 

I don't know but it winded up costing me an extra 8 bucks since some homeless guy ""who's wife just died"" just wanted to eat. So I emptied my wallet here in more ways then one. 

They did get our order perfect. Nice service and good food. I just tend to sit where I can see my car. Homeless people everywhere and who knows what else. But I helped someone and had a quick lunch with my mom and was energized through out the day.

25609,144,1,2021-04-20,"So I got an email from Jack-in-the-Box letting me know that the ultimate cheeseburger was half price. Monday is really big day for us as the kids have afterschool sports and then civil air patrol. I decided to buy some burgers for dinner. 

I opened the app and ordered 12 of the HUGE burgers @ 2 per child and 1 for me and my wife. I chose this location as it was closest to the pool the kids were at. Now a nice feature is that there is a button that pops up asking Jack-in-theBox to start cooking. It explains that they want you to have the order fresh, so you choose when they start it. It also said it would take 7 to 8 minutes to prepare. I figured since it was 12 burgers that it would take much more time so high I had them start it right away. We were approximately 10 minutes away as well as the kids were not finished working out. 

It actually took us 25 minutes to get to Jack-in-the-Box. My son went into grab the burgers and after about five minutes came out and said they still were not done. I went in side to find out what was the issue. I asked for the manager. She came up and I told her that it was 30 minutes for the order and asked why they were not done. In a fairly snippy, non-apologetic reply she said the order came in when they were's shift change. They were actually six workers, they were orders out the drive-thru window, one after another. Again I mentioned that it was 30 minutes and that it shouldn't take 30 minutes to make 12 burgers. The manager just walked away. I stood there and watch them put two burgers in each bag, they put the bag in the french fry warmer area. I stood there for about five more minutes and the manager came out and asked them to give us the burgers. I am completely miffed  why they did not hand me the burgers before she came back. They were done, sitting in the heater. Maybe she was a little passive aggressive that I was unhappy that it took 40 minutes for 12 burgers. 

So I guess don't do large orders for a large family with the app and expect to have good service? If you don't get good service, do not politely ask why, as this may extend your wait time. 12 Burgers should not be a burden on a fast food chain.

On the bright side, the burgers were quite good. The kids all said so. However they were rushed, and the cheese was not melted on any of the burgers. That didn't really affect the flavor though.",1,0,0,0

~First server...Returns with our iced tea and coffee.  Assures us that our server will be with us to take our order.
~Second server...Takes our order. Simple. We both ordered the same thing from the 55+ menu and two selected sides. We didn't ask for anything special.  
~Second server returns indicating that one of the 'sides' is not available. We make another selection. At this point, my husband informs server that the coffee is ""luke warm"" and server offers a choice, another cup or she will make a new pot. We opt for a new pot. (Why would he want a cup from the same pot the luke warm coffee came from??)

The meal arrives.  We ordered the Wild Alaskan Salmon.  There is neither lemon nor tartar sauce accompanying the meal.  We ask for lemon.  We dig in...my wild rice is dry, my salmon is unevenly cooked, raw in places and the corn (our substitute because there was no zucchini) was shaved right off the cob...anemic looking but it was actually the best part of my meal. Even the garlic bread was a dud...not toasted and doughy. To top it off, we were innudated with flies throughout our meal.  Because the side/emergency exit door was ajar, the flies were coming in at a rapid rate.  Perhaps it was the heavy metal music booming through the establishment that attracted them!

What should have been a pleasant experience, was a terrible disappointment.  So unlike this Denny's.  I wondered if they had changed ownership/management/staff...something changed.  In the past, we could always count on this Denny's for a warm welcome, a good meal and great service.

When we went to pay our check, the server (#2) didn't even ask us:  ""How was everything? How was your meal?""  Either she knew it was lousy or she just didn't care.  

Later that evening, my husband was feeling ill.  I am certain it was the undercooked fish.

Footnote:  I tried to use the Denny's Listens site to review this experience, but it was not allowing me to do so.  I noted that others had also attempted to use the site with the same results.

The kids ordered from the kids menu. My daughter ordered Dino chicken with a side salad and my son ordered spaghetti and a meatball (this is additional) and mashed potatoes and gravy as a side. Plenty of choices and the kids loved it. 

The hubby ordered a vegetarian omelet and I ordered the avocado chicken Cesar salad which comes with bacon slices. The food was the right temperature and was tasty.

25664,142,3,2021-11-15,"I'll start by saying the food was above par for this relatively simple and sometimes underwhelming fare (e.g., price, atmosphere & service). If it wasn't for this , my rating would certainly have been a star lower and possibly even two. 

In explanation, while the young waitress was friendly enough, she was somewhat informal, which usually doesn't bother me, almost to the point of being less than professional. As I'm the only patron and she appears to be a dedicated waitress, getting her attention and, at times, even simply finding her can be difficult. 

The last issue that bothered me was the background music. There was the standard piped in music through the ceiling mounted speakers which was to my liking. Unfortunately, at a volume slightly higher than the piped music, I'm confronted by music coming from the kitchen. Although less to my liking, I could easily live with either ""station"" separately, but I found the mix unpleasant and somewhat annoying as it resulted in a cacophony of sound. And, unfortunately, the waitress disappointed yet again as she informed me there wasn't anything she could do, when I pointed out the distraction and requested that only one music source be broadcast at a time. 

In the end, however, were I to characterize her service as largely underwhelming, I'd likely be overstating things. 

Update:  My waitress did come by to check on me. Again, pleasant enough. She even smiled in response to my concern as to whether ""I'd been forgotten."" The credit card bill just showed up -- of course, no pen! 

I'm tempted, but don't have the heart, to significantly short her tip. If times weren't so difficult, I'd seriously consider this option.


Overall, but for the surprisingly tasty food, my experience was disappointing. They could do a much better job with just a little more effort.

I hope they get a handle on the problem quick because I'd really like to come back to this location absent the unnecessary profanity and yelling.

UPDATE 2/19/17: I've been back to this spot and looks like they made some changes to the staff, perhaps applied some customer service training for the employees or removed just the one person that caused all the ruckus. Whatever changes applied it definitely noticeable and makes this place A-OK with me!",1,0,0,0
25685,166,1,2018-09-03,"A disaster!  My wife and I arrived at at 11:30 am on 9/2/18 with our two grandsons. There were three customers in the restaurant and five or six employees. Every table had dirty dishes on it and a couple of times one of the employees yelled from the other side of the restaurant that it would be a few minutes. After waiting about five minutes I asked if we could be seated and we were told that they would have to clean off a table and it would be a few minutes. We then decided to leave and one of the employees must have overheard us because she said they there were other Steak n Shakes to the east and west.

25686,160,2,2018-05-19,"Sorry, this place is going to be a hard pass for me. I've never had an $8 sandwich this skimpy before. I ordered the Pizza sandwich, and when you closed the roll, you couldn't even see the filling, and this was the 'bigs'. It looked like what amounted to 2 pieces of capicola, a few rounds of pepperoni and what appeared to be a slice and a half of cheese. That was topped with roughly half a crumbled up meatball. 

What saved this review from being 1 star was the marinara sauce, which had a good flavor, but when the bread makes up the majority of your sandwich, it'll be a long time before I go back.

I'd recommend going to a Subway before I'd suggest Potbelly. And I'm not a fan of Subway. I even deleted the Potbelly app from my phone.",1,0,0,0

We stopped going some time ago due to poor food quality but we decided to give them another try.

We knew just what to get that was not too heavy or too calorie laden.  For entrées, we both got varieties of their Triple Decker Club sandwich.  I got the turkey club ($9.08 with an extra charge for American Cheese). (see pic)  I had a choice of sides and I chose fries.  They did not skimp on the turkey and it was great!  

The other Club was a ham club ($9.08 with also an extra charge for American Cheese). (see pic)  The club was meaty and tasty.  The side that was chosen was the Avgolemono soup.  The soup was just OK because from living in the Tampa Bay area you become somewhat of a connoisseur of Greek Avgolemono soup. (see pic)

All in all, we had a great server, Maggie and our meal was pleasant.  I can certainly recommend the club sammies, Greek Salads and their breakfast menu but beware of the dinner entrée menu.

I went inside to place an order and could not believe that the mgr literally was coughing and ended up sneezing right on me. I was like so appalled that someone like this made no attempt to cover her hand over her mouth . This was disgusting and so I ended up walking out.

They don't have a menu online, but a Yelper posted a picture of the menu and it's fairly accurate. I don't think anything has changed. The first time I ordered takeout from here, I ordered two individual platters. It sounds like a lot, but it was not enough for my wife, myself and our two young children. The second time I ordered, I decided to go with the family special and this time, it was more than enough food. If you look at the menu, I ordered the family special #5 for $39.95. The special includes a 1/2 lb broiled salmon, 1/4 lb broiled scallops, 1/4 lb broiled shrimp, 3 Maryland Crab cakes (I actually received two; not three), 1/2 lb broiled flounder and 1 pint of any salad. Sounds like a lot of food right? Well, it is. Each fish came in a separate tray with rice, which was a little ridiculous, but not in a bad way. 

For the salad option, I chose the seafood salad. It was disgusting. It contained imitation crab, which does not taste good. The salmon was overcooked. We tried to eat it, but we just gave up. It was too tough. Other than that, I would recommend Lobster Claw if you want seafood for a cheap price. If you don't like imitation crab meat, stay away from the seafood salad and don't order the salmon. Everything else is good. Oh, and don't expect friendly service. They're not mean, but it's sort of like ordering from the soup Nazi if you've ever seen that Seinfeld episode. Don't expect to have a nice conversation about the weather or how good their meals are.

There is also an option for a party box! A box of burgers to bring to a party, bbq, or your next netflix and chill evening.

Don't dine inside....  

The main reason to not dine inside is the random ""420"" references made by the kids working here while standing next to their manager.  Sadly, no response to the crew member just a giggle from someone three times their age and who should be an example in the position they are in.

Also, the GM didn't have a name tag on.  I know the way I was trained was to let my crew know they are out of uniform if they didn't have their badges on.  Go home Miss GM and fix your uniform.

25828,182,2,2019-11-19,"Food was decent and the service was good. The reason for two stars is the kitchen. We ordered three duos, one trio, and one big burger. Almost every single burger had a mistake. They have all orders printed out when you receive them to make sure you aren't crazy. The ones that were supposed to have no sauce had sauce, the ones with no special handling had no sauces or missing toppings. Even after sending things back to be remade they still came back a second time wrong. They were so far in the weeds that the mistake just kept piling on. As such my kid sat waiting for almost 15 minutes after the rest of us finished eating. I get that restaurants have bad days, but this was by far from as busy as a mall location could get. I will give them props because the gluten free options are good and they do pay good attention to allergies. 

I decided to have to grace and hold off judgement until I could go back for a second try, I've had bad days overwhelmed and deep in the muck and had things run off the rails. 

For the second shot, a few days later, the location was pretty empty and we hoped things would be different. While the flavors are decent (ordered a ""big"" Spanish Beef), the quality control is poor. It looked like I had a slider on a big bun (see images attached). The burgers are cooked well done and a bit dry. They seem to be pretty conservative with toppings and sauces, which is a shame because the house sauce isn't bad and would help with the dryness. The ""fries"" which are round slices of deep fried potato are fresh and good. Overall the value is not worth the efforts. The burger meat quality is on par with Carl's Jr. and doesn't live up to their hype.

After looking at the menu on their website, we decided to order two Trios of Sliders so we could try all the different hamburgers they offer. In these trying times little things like trying new food seem extra fun. As a quick review, we liked all the things we ordered. The lamb and the salmon burgers were tasty and a nice change from a traditional burger. All the beef options were yummy. The fries are unique, and I won't explain why, so as not to spoil your food adventure. The onion rings are delicious! We chose to get the combos, which come with a drink, so we ordered milkshakes. I got a strawberry milkshake and hubby got the chocolate. What a delicious treat! We were so stuffed from the trio of Sliders that we couldn't finish our milkshakes, so we put them in the freezer to enjoy the next day.

The person who took our order and delivered our food was named Lindsey. She was wonderful, and what she told us is what made us extremely glad we ordered food there... She said the owner had kept all the staff on at their regular wages and was working hard to continue to do so. As an employee she expressed how caring and compassionate the owner was.

The Angus burger was good, nothing outstanding. The house sauce needed something like pickle relish as it was bland. The Greek Lamb burger came with greens, onion, tomato, and tzatziki sauce. The sauce was a good touch and made the lamb flavor come out. I ordered half onion rings and half ""fries"". The onion rings were thick cut onion and had a crispy breading, very tasty.

ATMOSPHERE:
It's set up like a Subway, with a cold line counter that you pick and choose ingredients to customize anything on their menu, except this is all American-Mexican fare.  The place was very clean with a few tables and big windows great for people & traffic-watching.

MENU:
Tacos, burritos, nachos, taco salads, quesadillas.

FOOD:
Taco Salad - I opted for ground beef which looks similar to Taco Bell's version (clumpy canned dog food lol,) with roasted chile corn, pinto beans, sour cream, and guacamole.  It definitely tasted way fresher than TB, and the guacamole was handmade (I saw the guy mashing it) and super fresh.  Yes!

Burrito - I got ingredients that I'd eat in case my spouse didn't eat it.  Flour tortilla, ground beef, pinto beans, sour cream and that fresh guac.  Yummo.  It's huge, like the kind you get in a Mexican restaurant and tasted very fresh as well.  No sauce needed.

SERVICE:
Both guys behind the counter were welcoming, friendly, and patient with this guy who has never been in a Qdoba.  Thank you!

We ordered two salads, a Greek and a Pita salad.  There was so much brown lettuce it was alarming. We tried to pick pieces out, but kept finding more.  Grape tomatoes were soft and had an 'old' tomato flavor. Half the cucumbers were translucent from either being too cold, or past their expiration date.

25914,182,4,2020-03-03,"This is our new favirite burger place! The location is prime to accommodate a fresh to order, delicious meal while out shopping or watching a movie. Because of this primo location, they are always busy. We tend to go during dinner hours & primarily on the weekend....during busy times, we expect to have someone in our party be ready to grab a table while waiting in line to order. They also have bar seating if you're alone or have a smaller party. Either way, it's worth the fuss. 

My family loves Burgerim for many reasons. Excellent service with a smile, super friendly & mellow vibe from everyone working there. 

The food is always fresh. They have a huge variety of protien options, beef, chicken, salmon, lamb... the gluten-free bun seals the deal for our teenager. The grilled chicken with lettuce wrap (no bun) is my favorite, with a delicious garlic aioli- heaven! The fries & sweet potato fries are also freshly made to order- always delicious. 

I have 3 complaints with food/beverage... reflecting in the 4* rating:
- Ventured from my usual and tried the wings recently. I do not enjoy breaded wings in any way. These wings had a great buffalo sauce, but the breading really ruined the experience. The chicken itself was very moist and good. 
- The side salad was 3 GIANT pieces of lettuce, like ones that would have been used to wrap the delicious chicken sandwich. They weren't chopped up much at all, I had to pull it apart with my fork because it was too busy to get up and snag a knife to cut it up. The cucumbers & tomatoes were super fresh. The onions were a little excessive but that's more preference I think.  I just didnt expect to have to cut up giant pieces of lettuce to eat my salad. 
- The Freestyle Coke machine is awesome, but they almost always are out of Dr Pepper. Almost every visit, theres a significant amount of soda flavors that are out of syrup/not available.  It's really not THAT big of a deal but it's annoying that its every time & different flavors every time.",1,0,0,0

After walking through The Outlets at Legends outdoor mall, we came across this trendy burger joint located near the Galaxy IMAX theater and we were not disappointed. 

I ordered the Duo Combo meal which included two 3oz burgers: I got one with a wagyu patty (for an additional $0.79), the regular toppings, and a fried egg and the other with their crispy buffalo chicken patty. I indulged in adding the garlic aioli fries as well. The wagyu patty was quite delicious, but it tasted quite similar to many Angus beef burgers I've had. It was, however, tender and juicy and made for a great burger. The crispy buffalo chicken patty was also tender and juicy on the inside, and had a great crunch on the outside. If you like spicy, this burger style will definitely hit the spot! The garlic aioli fries were served in round, potato slice shapes which was a welcomed change to the standard fries. The garlic aioli and parmesan topping was quite good, and the portions for this side was quite large, enough to share!",1,0,0,0

Over the phone they tell us that you can only cancel it online. We ask if they can make the food any quicker and they say no. 
Afterward we try to cancel our order online and there is nowhere to do it. So we decide to wait since we already paid. 
After our wait time is up we head inside. There was literally only one other family there. We tell them we had an order online except they cannot find it. 
My wife shows them the receipt and they say ""oh I thought you wanted to cancel that order?"" 
""We did but you said it had to be done online""
""Oh ok sorry we cancelled the order for you""
"".... but you didn't tell us that!""
They decide to make our order and say it will only be 10min (no idea why the initial wait was 45min).
We got our food 10min later and were not impressed.

Meal - Spicy Sandwich with large fires and a soda. It had cost me $9 for the lunch. The sandwich was pretty good with the pickles and bread. The fries were ok (it's like waffle fries with just salt). 

I was impressed by their drive-thru set up because they have multiple employees there - two people standing out there with portable POC devices and you pay right away, then the people direct you (saying behind which car you should pull up - there are two lanes that converge into one), there's the person at the ""sauces station"" who you tell what you want and they give it to you, then there's another person standing outside who hands you your order right to your window. Very hands-on and customer service oriented and friendly - so not used to that in general!

OMG!!!  Can you say full of delicious yumminess?!?!
Seriously, the nuggets didn't even need a dipping sauce, they were that good but of course I had to try a small bite dipped in a lil bbq (not a fan of that sauce) and a small bite dipped in a lil honey mustard which was indeed pleasant!  Still the chicken was the star.

The food was worth the wait. The moment I bit into the sandwich, my taste buds were in love. the chicken was coated with a proper amount of Buffalo sauce. I think the star of the sandwich was the spinach. This might sound weird, but the flavor of the vegetable was unlike any other spinach I've consumed. 

Let's take a minute to address the onion rings. Good Lord these things were great. The breading was crisp, not overbearing, flavorful but not to where things are going to be overpowered by the onion. They're great for sharing but seeing I was dining alone, I was a tad gluttonous. 

The only thing I wish they would have had was house-made BBQ sauce. I'm spoiled by places that make their own so seeing BurgerIM use the brand sauce was just so-so. Yes, I have two sides of it, but I didn't want ketchup for dipping. If the BBQ sauce was the minor sacrifice made in order to enjoy everything else, so be it. 

I strongly recommend this place the next time you're at The Outlets at Legends for a movie, shopping, lunch break, or a break from your 'usual' spot for food. I know I'll be back soon.

Next best part of service; the lady in charge accepted my post-order request to have an order of sweet potato fries added on. Since I'd paid for the impossible patty but didn't get it, she allowed me to punch in a last minute request for the fries that my kids had wanted, but I'd forgotten.

The first BurgerIM I visited was in Pleasanton, CA and it was a joy to the taste buds. So when we were visiting Sparks, I saw there was another location and my family had not tried it yet.

So we all decided with our fur ball to give this location a try. First thing, this is during COVID-19 caution and while there was social distanced indoor seating available we were unable to take advantage of this because of our dog. However there was some outdoor seating just outside of the front entrance. The staff were friendly and helped my wife understand the ordering options and there were plenty including a meatless option.

We opted for the Angus, Dry-Aged, and Crispy Chicken (with bacon of course) plus a side of their fries (which you have to give it a try). While these burgers are fully loaded sliders, two was plenty and three should satisfy even the largest of appetites.

When asked if there was anything else we would like, I commented it would be great if they had a pet-appropriate option. Our order taker said that would be cool, if they did. (more on this later)

The 6 burgers came out fresh in about 8 minutes or less. They looked very much like the photos and you could taste the quality of the ingredients unlike the fast food versions where your eyes tell you its a burger but here your taste buds don't lie. The house sauce and BBQ really help to enhance the flavors rather than mask them. The beef is quality and it tastes, well...like beef. The chicken breading was slightly more spicy/salty than I remembered. So know this going in.

The fries are round cut and most have are puffy the center, just like how I made them at home. Perhaps it's a location decision but here the serving of fries was easily double that I received in Pleasanton. 

To our surprise, our order taker brought us out a burger patty for our dog! She said they made it without any seasoning and it really made our fur ball's day! He wanted to finish it right away but we had to let it cool down and cut it up into bite size pieces!

Thank you BurgerIM Sparks NV for your hospitality and making sure our ENTIRE family was able to enjoy this time out from all this COVID-19 madness!",1,0,0,0

Drive thru - The newest trend where they have two lanes converging into one when you go to pay and pick up your order, whoever thought of this new trend to implement is a fool and it only accomplishes making it appear the line is shorter then it is to generate extra customers and dollars.

Service - The most lackluster service asking for my order it literally sounded like the guy wanted to be put out of his misery from behind the speaker phone, not saying you have to love your job but maybe have a cup of coffee or something before you start your shift to enhance your mood just a bit?

Picking up of order - Very young lad asked me what size I ordered (Communication needs to be worked on as I had ordered a meal and not just a drink) Also a random person walked up in front of me to window to say they forgot his marinara sauce.

Food - Ordered large fries, definitely did not look like an ample portion and was seriously lacking flavor, I will chalk it up to fries not being salted properly. Fries are better at McDonald's IMO. Original Chicken Sandwich - not bad...love the loads of mayonnaise they slop on it definitely generates a yummly junk food taste. I did not see the International Chicken Sandwich listed on the drive thru board however and did not feel like slowing down the line as the international is my go to chicken sandwich.

All of us agreed that the burgers were just so so. However, the fries in the form of small discs were some of the tastiest I have ever had. I would definitely go back for some fries.

26077,164,4,2016-10-09,"I frequently go to fast-casual restaurants and Qdoba is one of my favorites.  I live very close to the Arnold location and go there a couple times per month.  I have tried almost every item on the menu and I have never had any complaints.  My favorite menu item is the burrito bowl.  I usually get it with brown rice, black beans, chicken, corn salsa, habanero salsa, and guacamole.  Tonight I added sautéed veggies for something different and they were very good.  

The staff at this location is always friendly.  Once I went late at night as they were about to close, but they didn't seem annoyed at all.  They even had to get an ingredient from the back but did not seem frustrated in the least.  They even gave me a free soft drink while I waited since it took a few minutes longer.  The restaurant was recently remodeled and looks great.  The manager told me they lost some seating because of the remodel, but I have never noticed anyone not being able to find a table.

The only issue I have, which is not at all any fault of the restaurant, is that I always seem to get stuck behind people who do not know what they want.  However, I guess this just goes to show that they have a good amount of options to customize any meal.  They have 2 rice options, 2 bean options, 5+ meat options, 5+ salsa options, 2 queso options, plus veggies, guacamole, shredded cheese, sour cream, lettuce, etc.  

Qdoba offers a reward program where you earn a free meal for every ten that you purchase.  You can even get an electronic version of the reward card so that you can just scan your phone at the register to accrue the points.  The receipt usually has a survey on it which only takes a couple minutes to complete online.  It's worth completing the survey because you earn a free chips and salsa on your next visit.",1,0,0,0

1. The person who took my order was very friendly.
2. The pizza was good. Nice thin crust, good sauce and cheese. The pepperoni was good too. Probably would have been great if it had been hot, instead of barely warm.
3. The fries were ok, a bit bland.
4. The fondant cake was a mess. It is supposed to be chocolate cake with ganache on it (not sure why they call it fondant cake) . When it arrived the ""ganache"" had melted into a watery, oily puddle around the cake. The cake itself was soggy from the melted ""ganache"". Proper ganache is chocolate and cream melted together. This ""ganache"" looked to be chocolate and oil or shortening mixed in. When the ""ganache"" started to re-solidify there was white fat floating on top.

I probably should have ordered a chicken sandwich, but I ordered the crispy turkey sandwich instead only because I haven't seen anything like that on a fast food menu before so I went for it. This may sound strange for a review, but it was really well put together, not messy at all and really easy to eat. Well, I guess if you're going drive thru that is a good thing to know. The flavor was good, but I'm not sure if the cut of meat was enough because it seemed a little too fried and not too juicy. The menu says it comes with sweet sriracha sauce, but I didn't taste it and the sandwich was a bit dry due to the lack of sauce. Happy I had my milkshake to wash it down. I got zucchini fries, and they were too soft for my taste. I liked the regular fries better. They are cut thin and not greasy like some other places I've been too that have thin cut fries. The creamy garlic sauce was alright. I would try a different one next time. The tenders were actually really juicy, but not too crispy. And chicken tenders should be crispy right?

Then I drove by this brand-new building with PDQ on it. I knew it it had only been open a very short while, because I've seen the construction going on over the past few months.  I pulled in and grazed the menu.  Picked out a three tender crispy meal (seems to be a staple combo).  

I was hesitant to pay $7+ for three tenders, fries, and a drink when I'm right between two Chick-fil-A's and wasn't in the mood for chicken.  Or so I thought.  

To my surprise, my order was taken swiftly, and came out quick.  They called my name right after I got my drink.  I sat down and was a little disappointed (just wait).  The basket didn't look all that full.  But then I started to take a bite and knew why it wasn't that full.  The FLAVOR folks... the FLAVOR.  Wholesome ingredients and the way crispy  chicken should taste.  Light, flakey, thin with a hint of pepper and seasonings.  Perfect in my book.  The fries only added to the palette.  

And my sauce of choice was the Honey BBQ.  As is should be, the sweet taste of honey first, kicked with a few spices that don't overpower the honey.  

Again, a winner.  

They don't lie about the quality of the food and ingredients.  The atmosphere was very pleasing.  A lot of light, and they even serve Cheerwine!  And if you don't know what it is, then you must try it!

Crispy and juicy, but a tad oily for my liking. The flavor of the breading on the chicken is a little overpowering after a couple of bites, but the sauces can tame that. Sweet Sriracha for the win! The zucchini fries were a little oily as well, but still yummy. The past couple times I've been here, I've also had their French fries and specialty shakes.

Greeted, barely, by the girl working the counter who genuinely seemed bothered that I was ordering food. Maybe I'm ""spoiled"" by Chikfila and Shake Shack but you would think the person they put on the front line would have somewhat of a personality. This was McDonald's level customer interaction, basically. If I wanted that, I would have hit the dollar menu up the street. 
For 4 strips and zucchini fries with a regular drink, the total was over $10. While the food was decentit was in no way worth that much. Even the Coke coke machine, which I usually appreciate very much, dispensed a watered down vanilla coke.

The caesar salad was good but the dressing was very strong on the garlic side. I usually order my salads with extra dressing but it was a little strong for me this time.

26178,195,2,2016-02-15,"Let's start with putting my bias out there - the best Taco Bell gets four stars, almost all Taco Bells start with three stars.  This Taco Bell is less than average so I am giving it two stars.  

This location is near my college campus- which makes it a place I frequent a few times a month.  About a quarter of the time do I come away happy.  Taco Bell is junk food- It is my understanding that the original concept was opening a restaurant without any ovens or friers- just a microwave.  It has moved past that concept- but not entirely- and also added in more junk- fully incorporating Doritos and Fritos into food.  But, it is cheap, easy, fast. 

I like the breakfast sliders- I didn't think that Taco Bell would be one of the better breakfast options in the world of Fast Food- but they are.  If you get the chance give them a try- you will probably be surprised by how good your breakfast is compared to the likes of Burger King or Wendys.  (McDonalds, Hardee's, and What-A-Burger still win this contest- but I am surprised that Taco Bell has placed so well considering it is still new to the contest). 

This is a new location- so things still have a little shine on them.  It is landscaped well, the insides are clean and modern. 

The food is okay.  My order has been messed up a couple times.  It often is cold.  It is generally inconsistent. 

I am giving it two stars- because it is Taco Bell.  It less than average, but still adequate. No one goes to Taco Bell looking for the best meal of their life.  It will do in a pinch- but if you have the time -try the Publix deli next door.",1,0,0,0

Ordered a large pizza online.  Pizza was made quickly (too quickly as it was not fully cooked).  I ordered extra sauce but the pizza had so much sauce it was dripping everywhere (think 3-4x as much as a normal pizza, evrn more than you'd put on spaghetti)
I also tried the Toasted Parmesan crust flavor.  I found it to be disgusting
Most problematic of all was that the pizza was barely cut at all.  When you combined the massively excessive sauce and the doughy undercooked crust, it was nearly impossible to eat the pizza.
It was a mess of pizza slices torn in two with sauce dripping everywhere from the droopy pizza.

I love a good slice of pizza. Particularly, I like a NY slice, and I like a real Italian slice (though I don't see them that much). This place had both, but I opted for the NY slice, and got two slices of pepperoni and sausage pizza.

They were amazing. I mean look at the picture. The pepperoni slices were huge, and the sausage was actually meaty sausage, unlike what you would find at Domino's. It was one of the best slices of pizza I've ever had in my life. In fact, if I were to rank my top 5, it would go:

1. Cacciatori's Buffalo Chicken Pizza
2. DiMeo's Pepperoni and Sausage Pizza
3. Greenhill Deli Cheese Pizza 
4. Tony's Cheese Pizza
5. Grotto's Cheese Pizza

I might get a lot of sh/it for putting Grotto's on that list, but I personally feel that they are the flavor of Delaware summer. Just me. Back to DiMeo.

Everyone was super friendly, and the place was amazingly clean and upscale for being downtown. They had beer, unsweetened tea, and Coke Zero. You can't beat that.

26250,186,2,2018-05-26,"I am sort of surprised at how high this is ranked. Maybe this clouded our expectations and we ordered wrong, but literally not a single item we ordered came as described. 

First, we got the antipasto, which is actually listed differently on both the online ordering menu and the pdf menu, but neither is correct. The one we ordered said prosciutto di parma, fresh mozzarella, parmigiano reggiano, soppresatta, and a few other things. It was actually pepperoni, one tiny half circle of mozzarella, at the best, domestic prosciutto, but possibly shaved ham, and provolone. Worse yet, it was $18. I am seriously considering challenging the charge on my credit card.

Next, we got a pizza with sausage, eggplant and ""gaeta"" olives. The pizza was decent, but the olives were canned black olives. This was the closest they got to accurately fulfilling an order.

Finally we ordered the chicken bello which is supposed to come with vodka sauce. Instead, it was alfredo sauce. I suppose they are like the American cousins at the Italian family reunion anyways, but still, not a single item was prepared correctly.

Also the cut aspect must have been in question as it was not fully cut as in the edges of the crust were cut but no farther.

26283,188,5,2016-11-20,"The area has been in desperate need of a good sandwich place since there are few choices outside of your typical strip mall all-in-ones (pizza, steak, hoagie, fries, etc.), so this specialty sandwich shop is a welcome addition.

I've been eating here about twice per week since they've opened and I've consistently gotten a great tasting, well-made sandwich.  I've also gone back and forth between cold subs and hot sandwiches (highly recommend the Italian hoagie (get it ""Mike's Way""!) and Chipotle Cheesesteak) and everything has been great.  They seem to bake their own rolls in-house too and they're ALWAYS fresh, which is the first step to a great sandwich.

If you want a great sandwich, give these guys a try.  You won't be disappointed.

One tip for customers...try to dine in if you can if you live more than 5 minutes away.  I've found that the sandwiches don't travel well.  The bread is fresh, so it quickly absorbs the ""Mike's Way"" oil/vinegar mixture that they put on the cold sandwiches (if you elect to have that, which I strongly suggest you do!) and melted cheese from cheesesteaks, etc.  If you're not eating the sandwich in under 10 min of them making it, then the roll will likely be pretty wet by the time you do.  I mentioned this to a friend and they suggested that when ordering ""to go"", that I ask for a ""fisherman's wrap"", which they explained is when they place a piece of wax paper over the roll and then put the ingredients on top of that (to protect/preserve the roll).  Then when you get home, you pull out the wax paper and you have a good sandwich with the roll still freshly intact.  I haven't taken out from JM's since my friend suggested that, but may try the next time I go and hopefully they'll accommodate me that way.

One suggestion for Jersey Mike's...about half the times I've gone to your place for lunch, it's been with a different group of friends from work and we've all enjoyed it, but all seem to agree on this one point...you need another size between a Regular and Giant.  We all feel like when we get to the end of a regular, we still want a bit more...but the Giant is too big!  Sure, we probably COULD polish off a Giant if push came to shove, but it's really too big for one person, and we all agreed we would never order it if dining with anyone because it would be too embarrassing and we'd feel like a pig for ordering that much food.  But seriously Jersey Mike's...think about it.  I'd bet that at least 1/3rd of the guys that come in there would order a larger size than the Regular, but smaller than the Giant IF that option was available.  And if your average Regular is about $8 and your average Giant is $14, you could insert an in-between size for like $9.95 and not only would you be making a lot of customers happy, but you'd be increasing your average sandwich sale by 25% on a third of your business.

On the call I was told that I would be able to walk in the day of and place the order and it would take 45 minutes. The next morning I walked in to place the order, everything written down to make placing the order much easier. However when trying to place the order the manager explained an order this large couldn't be done. Even after we were told prior it was okay. Then after he finally decided it was okay, he went through the list of orders and mentioned how some items weren't available, even though they were on the online menu and the menu boards in the store. Then explained that the three croissant sandwiches couldn't be made because there weren't enough for three, there were two croissants out. So then I had to explain that well two of the three could in fact be done, we would just have to change the bread on one. He continued going through saying what could and count be done until he finally started on them and said it would be 45 minutes.

First, I'm grading on a curve because the place is new and they made some rookie mistakes with my order (I drove through: no napkins, chicken and zucchini was too greasy - probably under the heat lamp too long - I was there at 3:00pm, not a traditional meal time).

The chicken tenders were a bit too greasy for my taste and my order was filled incorrectly. I wanted and ordered 3 but got and paid for 5. The order taker at the window where you pick up the food didn't seem to care that my order was filled wrong when I mentioned that my tab was a little high for 3 tenders, fries and no drink, then I saw that the order was for 5 not 3 tenders, again, these are rookie mistakes.  But the quality of the chicken was great, very moist and tasty except for the excess grease.

Zucchini was also greasy but again very tasty. If the order had been fresh and not so greasy I think this place would have deserved a 4 or 4 1/2., because despite the grease, the taste was great.

I gave this location The 5 stars rating because it was spot on in quality, speed and above all friendliness.

So then we tried to order the Chicken Tender Po'Boy... only to be told they were discontinued by the Chicken Sandwich (which was not available yet, lol!)

So we ordered some Chicken Tenders with Red Beans and Rice, and a drink.  Love the red beans and rice here.. yum!

This was 1:00 pm on a Sunday... and they were actually very busy, which I found surprising. Even more surprising was the wonderful service!! Tabitha was the manager on duty, and even though she was very, VERY busy... she kept on smiling, giving each customer personal attention... and also taking time to kid around with her staff and encourage them to smile too. And she was down on staff as apparently two people had called in sick, or not shown up. Amazing... I would have been screaming cranky at that point! She was awesome, as was her staff... smiling and doing everything they could to make you happy.

They were also out of some things, and the main Soda machine was out of order, so they were filling drink orders on the drive thru machine.

The representative said that an additional Burger King representative from a different department would be in contact with me to help me convert my printable BK e-gift certificate, into a slide able BK gift card since my local BK restaurants (this BK and 1 other location) either don't want to process the information on the printable e-gift certificate or don't know how or, was improperly trained on how to process this type of payment (this includes the managers).  I will never again redeem my rewards points (Microsoft Rewards Program) for any BK products or services as I have just redeemed 6 years of saved points for $30.00 in useless printed BK e-gift.  It's really a hassle to drive all the way to a BK restaurant, place an order, then be turned away hungry. It's so upsetting that this issues still goes unresolved. Regrettable, I will not be patronizing any of your establishments (e-gift nor cash) in the future.  I realize I'm just one guy and my choice not to give you any more business will probably not even effect your bottom line in anyway. More importantly, it has tarnished some fond memories of my employment with BK, as it was my first job out of high school. As a youth, I recall a BK that cared about all their customers and no concern was too small to be addressed, as the customer was truly valued.

He also never gives you a receipt and it seems to cost a different price every time. It's a shame because they have the best quick bacon egg and cheese breakfast sandwiches in my opinion in the area but they only get it right sometimes. If you call ahead you will be placed on hold and never answered. The mannerisms of the owner reflect him not wanting customers.

26405,183,5,2016-06-09,"For a while now I been following the progress of the brand new PDQ being built in 
Cherryhill NJ after stumbling across it a few months back on instagram. 
It really got my attention when I found out it was coming soon to NJ. 
I love when something new opens close and I am a fan of Chick-fil-a but this
looks like a better version of it. First off they make everything in house. 
The fries are cut, homemade sauces, fresh chicken, baked cookies, real shakes.
Okay they all sound like winners. So I was able to get a invite to the staff training 
days preceding the grand opening to the public (6/12/16) and to top it off
all of the food is FREE. Fuck ya food boner. I know what you thinking free food always tastes better.
I put it in my head as if I paid for it to give it a fair evaluation. 
First thing. I really like the decor and set up inside. very nice for a fast food place.
Now onto the grub. 
The chicken fingers were on the small side but had a very well seasoned breading that
really impressed me. If it was a meal I would need like 10 of these to fill me.
The fries looked good, but fell a bit flat. Not hot at all. They were busy so maybe that
was it, I will definitely give them another chance. But the real humdinger were
the zucchini fries. Fucking scrumptious, can't believe im saying this about zucchini 
but they really impressed me. All of the sauces I tried also were outstanding. 
It was hard to pick any favorites of the three I had 
so I dipped everything equally among them.
My banana pudding shake had real bananas in it and wow was it good. Sad to see it is a 
seasonal shake, it should be a permanent flavor. There is a lot of other choices but this 
was a real standout.
Cookies were very good as well.    
Well I now have a new favorite chicken place to hound over. Thanks for the amazing 
food, will be back very soon. Probably Sunday.",1,0,0,0

To be honest, it is the best crispy chicken sandwich I've ever had. The spicy is far better than the classic. It tastes so good even if they forgot my pickles they still get four stars. 

Having to wait in a fast food restaurant for 45 minutes to get these was not the most pleasant experience. I've never given somewhere four stars that messed up my order and made me wait a long time.

Initially I was upset because my order apparently wasn't processed and took about 2 hours to get to me, long story. Then I open the box and see there is no marinara sauce for my cheese calzone, at first I was pissed and literally called them immediately. I was on hold when I took a bite and literally dropped my phone, as I was chewing I realized that it was the best calzone I've ever had in my entire life, all the fury evaporated (yes evaporated like fricken condensation) and I was overcome by sheer bliss. The cheese was perfect, the ricotta to cheese ratio was exactly how I like it- not excessive, extra ricotta, you can tell it was fresh mozzarella, and then the sauce, the perfect amount of marinara sauce that wasn't overpowered with garlic or herbs but just straight, simple fresh tomato sauce- seasoned to perfection- not salty at all, just perfect. The crust, ahh the crust, this is what took it over the edge, words can't even describe the crust-cooked perfectly, not soggy or hard, hearty and rustic, with a wood fired taste and a tiny hint of sweetness, just perfect, not greasy or dripping with cheese and saturated fat but literally a perfect, wood fired, well done calzone.

Now, the workers said in order for me to claim that email coupon i had to buy 2 tender meals in order to get the one free. Obviosuly i met that with some confusion but didnt argue and simply agreed to it. So i canceled the sandwhich at this point with the understanding i now had to buy 2 tender meals to get my free one.

26416,186,4,2016-02-11,"It was National Pizza Day so I decided to diversify myself and try a new pizza place. 

It was a snowy evening and I literally was the only person in this place. Based on the quality of the food, the friendly service and all the great reviews I'm quite sure that this emptiness isn't the norm.

I tried the Brussel sprouts, the Domenica Pizza, and as If that wasn't enough for a solo dinner I  thought it was a good idea to order the Nutella bites. 

Everything here was delicious. I was skeptical of the sprouts bc they came in a broth which I've never seen, but they were tasty.  The waiter said they were fried, they weren't. It was okay though, because I devoured this dish immediately.  My pizza was good...high quality ricotta, tomatoes, garlic and fresh spinach. Crust was on the thinner side which I like and had a perfect crispness to it. I ordered a side of sauce and was delicious for crust dipping.   

The Nutella bites, 5 stars!  The dough was perfect and the Nutella, cmon, it's freakin Nutella!!!! Sprinkled with powder sugar this $10 dessert is worth it if you have a few people to share with. If not, it's worth the belly pains, just go walk a mile or 4.

Service was just okay. Waiter wasn't too informed on the different pizzas and hadn't tried many to suggest. He was friendly, yet distracted, so maybe he was having an off night.

I had the Buffy Bleu sandwich and tried some chicken tenders, all of which tasted very high quality for the amount of time it took for them to make it. They came out very hot and very juicy. The fries were good - not spectacular - and the tater tots were probably a bit better. And the prices were all in the range of a typical burger joint type of fast food place. Not bad!

The interior was clean and comfortable and they had an employee dedicated to keeping it that way. Everyone was super polite. They had UFC on a couple of TVs. I kind of wish the menu was a bit bigger so there would be more reason to go back repeatedly. But the things PDQ does, it does really well.

I wasn't sure what I was going to get, but when I saw some of the roast beef sitting on the grill with melted cheese...I was very interested...so much that someone offered me a slice of roast beef and I knew I had to have one!

They have a couple TVs, and a good amount of seating available.  Stop in and say Hi to Jersey Mike!

Restaurants that deliver, particularly in the evening, are few and far between in downtown Wilmington.  Honestly, the fact that DiMeo's delivers probably bumps it up to at least three stars in my book.  

Bumping it another star to four are the reasonable prices and tasty food.  The small pizzas are usually enough for two meals.  The truffle fries are quite tasty and crisp and come with a side of palate flattering aioli.  I usually go with the BBQ pizza, which has a nice balance of toppings, generous portions of chicken, and an appropriate amount of BBQ sauce.  I top it with my office sriracha before eating, which adds a nice garlicky kick and cuts down on the sweetness of the BBQ sauce.

He overcharged me and said ""oh, we changed the prices, but I have not had time to change the board"" - funny, it went back to the usual price the next day and thereafter.  He rang up another customers purchase on my debit card and didn't say anything until I asked him what he was doing, then a fast talking ""explanation"" - he was planning on not saying a word, thinking I didn't notice.  And Nicole M is correct, he never gives you a receipt.   My husband gave me a gift card for Christmas....I have the toughest time using it with the owner (the other employees are very nice and funny it always works when they cash me out) - more than once... For example, this morning....he said ""we are not accepting the gift cards any more, they don't work"" - I said they better work or I'm going somewhere else.  AMAZING!  It worked.  He just doesn't want to take the gift cards, since they are pre-paid purchases and don't increase his daily tally.   He is really someone you need to watch - I don't doubt many people are over/double charged and never even realize it.

We proceeded to drive to the establishment and asked why we were denied delivery, the employees said they ran out of product. 

That's fine...however it is your fucking job to update the delivery application so you aren't waisting your time or the customers time. It's not the customers fault that you don't value yourselves enough to find actual careers. It's not the customers fault that you settled for less. 

Don't like the work don't take the job. But don't do things or say things you wouldn't want others to say to you.

First person I spoke with was kinda rude(female). Second person I spoke to was a lot nicer(male).

However right after I said something the lights mysteriously came on.. wow shocker.. anyhow the young man who took my order was very apologetic and attentive. I honestly have no complaints about him.

When I got inside there was one person in front of me, a door dash driver. The staff was going back and forth with him signing that his order was already picked up. This went on for about 5 minutes till the drive gave up and left. As I mentioned I was next in line.

It took about 10 minutes for my sandwich to be made, but at least I knew that it would be nice and fresh upon getting it. Along those same lines, my sandwich was nice and warm upon being given to me.

Once I was home, I ate my sandwich while watching a college football bowl game. The steak was tender and flavorful, which went well with the American cheese. The peppers, which were a bit sweet, added a good touch. I will admit that I wish they added some sauce, like vinaigrette on top, to add a little touch of flavor.

Another Yelper said it best: they should review their sub sizes. And post the actual sizes. To me, these aren't really subs; they're large sandwiches light on meat/cheese, heavy on shredded lettuce.  $8+ for a 7"" (I measured) sub is preposterous and slicing the meat/cheese in front of the customer (thinly, I might add) is a gimmick designed to distract them from the fact the meat/cheese quality is  mediocre. 

Both the Meatball and Italian were bland and unimpressive.  The Famous Philly, surprisingly, was quite good; the meat was a reasonable portion and wasn't hacked to bits. Be aware they have the audacity to deem this a Philly steak yet use White American cheese. These concept originated in our neighboring state, not in Arkansas, so what's the excuse?

The last time that I went was December 29, 2021. The drive thru was again coned off. I walked up to the door and it was unlocked.

I immediately told her that I placed a mobile order that was paid in full. She gave me several side eye, dirty looks before giving me my food. As I was waiting, someone went to lock the door so that no one else could get in. She told the side eye employee ""mobile orders only."" How can they give mobile orders if they locked the doors and the drive thru was closed? Another patron walked up to find the door locked and he kicked the door from frustration. It was probably very frustrating to see that I was in there being served which was just pure dumb luck. The side eye employee has forgotten to lock the door as she was sorting the mobile order receipts; one of which happened to be mine.

It's really 3.5 stars, but I'll bump it up to 4 for the staff still politely catering to me 5 minutes before closing.

  Ordered the zucchini fries and the grilled turkey sandwich (""handheld thanksgiving"") cuz to be honest I was recently craving a Wawa Gobbler and thought this may be the nicer option. 

Zucchini fries were crisp and pretty good for the first half of eating the order, but after a while they do become quite salty to your palate.  You can appreciate that these are less greasy than most other place's, however.  Love their creamy garlic (reminds me of a creamier Papa John's garlic dipping sauce) and ranch sauces.  Ranch works better with the zucchini fries, thanks to the cashier's recommendation.
*Extra sauces don't cost extra!

The sandwich...was fine.  Didn't blow my mind, but not bad.  The turkey was tougher than I was expecting, kinda like one of those turkey burger textures.  I was expecting something more tender, I suppose.   The flavored mayo and cranberry sauce were pretty good, lettuce fresh. 
Personal preference, but the brioche buns here are a little grainier than I prefer.

For instance we usually get one of these subs/ hoagies toasted at other places but here they are not able to do that, not even toast the roll even though there was a hot flattop sitting there vacant of any use at the time. 2 of the subs were to have 3 different types of meats on them, when we got home and ate them we realized that the only meat on them was ham, that's it.

The pros: 
The place is very clean, and they get big time brownie points for having a wash basin at the entrance.

There are also 2 coke freestyle machines, an inviting layout (with TV's) and Heinz ketchup that doesn't have HFCS (fructose allergies are rising & it's organic)

The cons:
Unfortunately, they do not do chicken sandwiches as well as Chick-Fil-A IMO. My gf had the crispy chicken and I had the honey butter. We were both disappointed. The unique spice blend of CFA that incorporates white pepper and thyme has a much stronger flavor profile than the overly salty breasts here. All we tasted was salt. 30 mins after eating our lips and fingers were immediately letting us know we just overdid it on the salt.

The sides were just Ok as well. The Zucc Fries were greasy, and would probably be better in the shape of coins. The regular fries were shoestring and also pretty salty.

Overall, I would eat here again. But, If i did, I would probably try tenders/nugs and based on that experience shift my rating to a 2 or a 4.

Generally that's when a business puts its best foot forward. But I must admit the standards are of high quality at all times. Our cashier was friendly, patient and helpful. The prices are very reasonable for the amount of food you receive. Another impressive aspect is the always clean dining area and the hand washing station. I was pleasantly surprised there was a big screen television showing sports, nice touch.

My mother who is extremely picky was so happy and satisfied with her Classic Salad. I was relieved because that rarely happens! I had the Mediterranean Salad with the lemon chili dressing, simply delicious. The dressing had just enough heat and that tang of citrus. Mom had the classic salad with crispy chicken. She loved the lemon chili dressing as well. The fresh squeezed lemonade totally blew her away because she hates the fact restaurants only sell 'artificial' iced tea and lemonade made by CocaCola. The only negative, salads do not qualify as a 'meal' making the zucchini fries $1.49.

Brand new Jersey Mike's location near the Giant superstore.

Both my wife and I ordered the Philly Cheesesteak with a side of marinara sauce and we're thoroughly happy with the order. 

Only a couple reasons why this is four stars:
1) The wait time was tremendous despite a huge number of staff behind the line. I imagine this is just a factor of being newly opened and they'll figure out how to speed the process as time goes on. 
2) Online ordering was not yet available. I believe they have this in other locations, so maybe it will be up by the next time we go back.

26611,201,4,2021-07-30,"I've had a light addiction for tuna hoagies of late, and this Friday afternoon I found myself thinking about satisfying it again. Yelp alerted me to a Jersey Mike's down on Street Road in the Giant shopping center in Feasterville, about seven miles away. I found their app and ordered a standard sized sub with sesame seed roll, and added tomato, mayo, black pepper, lettuce, banana hot and sweet peppers. I drove down and arrived as the staff was finishing my order. It was right on time.

Back at the office I opened the twisted end wrapper and beheld a beautiful sandwich, if shorter than expected. First bite disclosed that the roll was superlative with bakery freshness, great texture and ideal flavor. On the other hand, the tuna tasted ""thin,"" and lacking substance - not really all that good. The banana peppers and sweets were no where to be found. The actual eating experience was satisfactory despite these drawbacks, but could have been so much better had there been more quality control on the tuna salad and double checking the desired ingredients. 

Overall, Jersey Mike's is somewhere in the middle of the pack of chain sub shop tuna hoagies available locally. Generally, mom and pop delis do them better, but there is wider diversity in how the tuna is prepared and more inquiry is needed to be sure each recipe has what you want in your sandwich.

What happened was, in their quest for efficiency & demand fulfilment, this location prepared God-knows 20(?), 30(?), 100(?) of these sandwiches prior to the lunch period in anticipation of the usual high demand.  Unfortunately the foil-lined bag containing this sandwich acts as a steamer when sealed.  Thus the crust was wet, soggy, disgusting. ACK

If I ever waiver from my 3 mild chicken tenders, side, & biscuit ever again, I'll order the sandwich with tomato, lettuce, mayonnaise, onion, & mustard as additional condiments.  This will ensure I get one that's both freshly made as well as more complex in its flavors.

26664,192,1,2021-12-13,"6:40 p.m. Sunday, Dec. 12, 2021... I pulled into the BK on Clear Acre Lane in North Reno drive thru.  The lobby seems to always be closed evenings.  I had been there the night before and tried their Texas double burger and it was good, so after work I had my heart set on another, even though it had taken almost 20 minutes in the drive thru to get my burger.

As I sat there, 3 employees started waving me forward but there was a car about 5 feet in front of me.  There was one car behind me and they were motioning her to move forward against me when they were already within about 2 feet of me.

I rolled down my window to say I was fine (I dont like being deluged with smog being on someone's tail (all drive-thrus should have declines so ee can coast and not idle)...so I told them I was fine.

They told and motioned me to move forward again.  I said I'm fine here.  They said they were closing the lane and I had to move forward and were aggressive about it.

 ""Are you closing? What time do you close?""

They told me to just pull forward.  I asked again so I would know for next Sunday after work what time they closed.  I just wanted to know for future reference.  Is that too much to ask.  The 3 of them again refused to respond, waving me to move forward.  

""Is it that difficult a question to know when you close?""

They started laughing and said ""Just move forward.""

I got out of my truck, walked back to the lady behind and asked her if she would be so kind to back up so I could leave.  

She backed up and I got in my car and told the 3 now standing there arrogantly laughing and waving good-bye as I backed up and told them what dumb assholes they are not being able to answer a simple question... as they continued to wave and laugh and saying things that I couldn't make out because the grenade took a bit if my hearing.

...and the other car behind me, watching the entire scene, left as well.

Apparently, your workers are more interested in ridiculing and harassing customers and driving them away than they are in answering simple questions about hours of operation.   My first job in high school, before I went into the Marines, was working for Burger King.  I learned about Customer Service from Burger King in the early Seventies, before my Marine Corps service.

 Maybe they didn't like my Marine Corps stickers and license plates.  Maybe they hate those of us who have actually engaged in service.  I don't know, but whatever their personal mental issues...they should check those at the workplace door and not spill them onto the customers. 

Whatever you're paying them, and if any of them were management...you're paying them too much.

I've been a loyal patron of BK for 50  years...no more.  I'll buy patties and make my own at home on my George Foreman Grill.  Given the wait times now at BK... it'll probably be quicker, too..and I won't have to deal with the personal issues of rude and abrasive employees with serious mental issues against the customers.",0,1,0,0

26671,183,5,2016-10-31,"PDQ (People Dedicated to Quality) is a cool new chicken chain to come to the Philadelphia area, with Cherry Hill being its first location. It's a gorgeously colorful, modern place to sit down and eat.

It's schtick is to serve fresh made food and being conscious about the environment. Sorry, I can't comment on how they are more environment-friendly than other chains, but I will vouch for the food being fresh and delicious!

PDQ's claim to fame is its fresh chicken, for which most items can be ordered either crispy (coated & fried) or grilled. It serves nuggets, strips, sandwiches, salads, etc. and so on. 

I got the basic, fried chicken strips just to try a standard item. Folks, this is a true cut of meat here; no processed, mashed up, fillers-diluted meat like you get at so many other places. You could peel the chicken apart (as I did in the one photo I took) and see the meat grain. And it was delicious, even though my own personal opinion likes to have a nice bit of spice in my coating (which this did not have). For my tummy, they seemed a little pricey for the quantity that you get.

On another visit I tried the honey marinated chicken nuggets - and I love love love them, probably my favorite item by far! The coating is far from obvious honey flavor, but it's just got that little extra 'somethin' to it that makes it deelish. They do have a honey butter chicken sandwich, but the buttered bread is just a little too much for my carb-concious brain, not that it's not delicious (I've had it once and loved it). 

The nuggets come with a 'honey bbq' sauce as a standard, but I found the Chipotle BBQ and honey mustard sauces to be my favorites by far for my personal taste. I love the PDQ 'honey mustard', and I typically don't care for honey mustard sauces.

PDQ has great drink area. There are a couple of those Coke Freestyle machines (tons of varieties of sodas available) and there are a few varieties of fresh teas available too. If you drink a river of unlimited refills like I do, this gets a gold star!

PDQ can get a little more pricey ($4.99 for 3 rather measly tenders); but I have to try to keep in mind that this appears to be true quality food. Apparently I just can't come to grips with the concept of why less-processed food costs more than more-processed food does - that goes for any place, not just PDQ.

     A few weeks ago I broke my leg, so I can't get out of the vehicle which is fine because they only offer drive-through at this point in the COVID-19 crisis. Last week I stopped and got a chicken strip meal and a side salad for later at home. The side salad was huge and filled the bowl completely. It's difficult for me to get up and down stairs where I live but I took the effort so that I could pick up a few side salads to eat at home when I can't get out. I got home today and was completely disappointed with what was in the bag. The salads I purchased were half the size of last week and some of the lettuce was even brown. I suppose I'll add them together to make one salad, pick out the brown lettuce and reconsider all the effort it took to get to PDQ for this kind of an inferior product. I've had to lower my stars to two even though they normally are a 3 to 4 star experience.

ORIGINAL REVIEW: I really want to like this place. The chicken nuggets are very tasty and a hot. The zucchini fries are nice and light, hot and ordered with no salt, are very flavorful. I love the sauces that are made in house, those are all great as well. Now, the reason why they don't have five stars. 
The music is very loud which I don't mind but you can't hear the cashier and have to ask her to repeat herself several times. This is happened on my last two visits and all I want to do is communicate my order.
Now the part that bothers me the most. When I pulled in the parking lot I saw the man in the white coat with ""PDQ"" on it, having a cigarette in the parking lot next-door. He then flicks a cigarette into the parking lot which, as a fireman, bothers me when people do that. We walked into the restaurant right after him. I've included a nice picture of the retro handwashing station right inside the door, which he passed. I saw him going to the back into the cooler and bring out some salads prepackaged without washing his hands yet. He then commences to start working in the kitchen making the zucchini fries that I love so much. Thank God he put on gloves because I don't like cigarettes and would hate to have unwashed hands touching my food.

I have given him and his leadership team ample opportunity to respond to my  customer service concerns at this location but they have fallen short in a spectacularly awful manner. I continue to witness poor customer service to this day.

I really want to like this place. I do. But I cannot bring myself to patronize an establishment that frankly doesn't value its customer base and treats them so poorly.

Let me recount a recent experience:

In mid-May, I asked to add turkey sausage to a bagel but the manager told me his computer system didn't support such a request. I asked if I could simply pay him extra, but he wouldn't budge. Fine, I said. I enjoyed my sandwich minus the turkey sausage. I had previously ordered such a sandwich with said turkey sausage but it seems that it wasn't meant to be this time around.

On my way back home, I decided that I would lodge a complaint with the corporate office. Which I did. I got a call about two weeks later from the manager who informed me that there was a ""new guy"" at the register who simply didn't understand the computer system. He invited me to come back for a free sandwich, which I gladly accepted. I had high hopes that things were getting better.

Just today, I stopped in to cash in on the offer he made. The ""new guy"" in fact wasn't new at all. It was the same person (the manager) who had taken my order in May. What a liar and a con! I wasn't born yesterday, man! I was on to his game.

I got in line. There was a customer in front of me having a somewhat heated conversation with this same manager. It seemed that the customer's 20% off coupon wasn't valid on his order since he didn't order a salmon bagel. I later saw the coupon myself; nothing there mentioned a salmon bagel or any similar restriction.

I ordered and then stepped aside to inquire about this customer's predicament while my sandwich was being made. Sure enough, after our conversation, the manager pulls me aside to explain his side of the story. It wouldn't have been so bad if the manager simply used facts and took ownership of the situation. Alas, he decided to berate the customer and explained that the customer complains all the time. He even went so far as telling me that he had no control over the situation, which was obviously false. 

So, in summary, if you want to patronize a place run by a man who lies, refuses to take valid coupons, and treats his customers like garbage, please be sure to visit this Manhattan Bagel location. Otherwise, I suggest that you go elsewhere in search of your breakfast or lunch.",0,1,0,0

26699,188,4,2017-05-25,"I work at ""The Dump,""  which is a nearby furniture store. And today we got a big order of Jersey Mike's hoagies. They have these food display boxes that make for a nice presentation. Also, the portion size is good. A light eater won't be overwhelmed. A more hungry person can go back to the box for seconds or thirds.

But here is what we found exceptional about Jersey Mike's...

Their chocolate chip cookies are phenomenal!  

This is not merely food. This is not merely a snack. Rather, these cookies are a decadent, highly satisfying dessert experience. I mean... yummy!

These delicious round discs are loaded full of slightly gooey chocolate chips. My co-worker George doesn't understand how they are able to achieve this gooiness. He is mystified about how they are able to cook them like this. He described the cookies as ""sensational.""

George and I aren't the only fans of these cookies. The supply we had of them disappeared quickly. The word got around.

Anyway, Jersey Mike's makes an outstanding chocolate chip cookie. Highly recommended.

One other thing... we previously had an issue with a Jersey Mike's catered event at our store. There was some miscommunication apparently. I want to say that Jersey Mike's made things right. We're happy.",1,0,0,0

Then they served tasteless soft serve ice cream. I pointed this out and the staffer tried it and agreed; it was a hot day, I wanted something cold, I ate it regardless. Must have left out a flavoring, like the vanilla and sweetener, as it tasted like frozen milk. Sandwiches are always good, despite service issues.

Original review:  for Castro Valley location: good food offerings but doesn't quite seem to be made as well as Dublin's location, not as fresh (their timing of sides and sandwiches prep do not match) and the guest service not quite up to par either, thus 4 stars. At Dublin, staff walked around asking each guest how they're doing. That did not happen at Castro Valley.",1,0,0,0

26791,244,4,2020-09-14,"Absolutely love Sonic for their happy hour are there ice creams, shakes, slushies and limeade, but if they're not on happy hour the price is little much I mean for my taste I believe ice cream she never be that much or should I say with some flavoring mixed with it should never be that much I mean the slushies. What things cost so I get it the line in the Drive-Thru is always really really long and takes a long time, but I know it takes a while for things to be cooked or made and sometimes they're short-staffed so it's understandable. The employees are staff I pretty much respectable depending on I hope you and how their day is going that's anybody right, oh and when they have half price wings those are really good you should try them",1,0,0,0

Not so with this location when I visited.  I know they are all franchise stores and it seems like this location is trying to save money by putting almost no meat on?
